        <div>The goal of the Rice University course Management for Science and Engineering (MSCI-610 - ENGI 610) is to provide the skills for science and engineering to meet the challenges of their future careers, whether they be in academia, industry, or as an entrepreneur. The course was started in 1998 and has evolved over the years. The course is taught to undergraduates, graduate students, and professional masters students and involves the areas of organizational behavior &amp; leadership, accounting, marketing, strategy, entrepreneurship, and project management. It is this last area that is covered in this book. Irrespective of your future career in science and engineering you will be involved in projects and an awareness of the factors that enable a successful project is important for all team members. It should be recognized that the topics included in the book are not limited to scientists and engineers, they are useful for people in any careers. This course is not aimed at making you a certified project manager, but to provide the skills that will allow you to be a more effective project team member and also when you are dragged screaming and kicking into the role of accidental project manager. </div>

    <section data-depth="1" id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169342817912"><h3 data-type="title">Congratulations... you're the project manager!</h3>
      <div data-type="note" id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_eip-410">The following is based on, and adapted from, the premise of <em data-effect="italics">The Education of Jerry</em> by J. Davidson Frame in <em data-effect="italics">Managing Projects in Organization</em>, John Wiley, New York (1995). </div><p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169341300609">John picks up the phone before the second ring. It's his boss, Mike Johnson. "John, I'd like you to stop by my office right after lunch today." </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169346109228">John is not really sure why the boss is calling him into his office, which makes for a long lunch hour. He knows he's been doing a good job lately. As a matter of fact, he knows that he's probably the most technically capable person in the group. John's mind begins to race…. Maybe it's an award? Could it be a promotion? Countless positive and negative scenarios run through John's overworked mind until one o'clock finally rolls around and he cautiously enters Mike's office. </p>
      
      
      
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169342652072">"John, I've got some great news for you," Mike begins. "As you know our company is developing a business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce system. As part of that initiative, I’d like you to explore the possibility of integrating our purchase order process into the B2B e-commerce system."</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169346227011">Before John could say anything Mike continued, "Congratulations, John, I'm assigning you as the project manager. Use anyone you need to help you; the important thing is to give me a report on your findings within a month. Your preliminary investigation will give us an idea of how we should go about computerizing the order processing function at BizNex Inc., and we need that information in time for our next quarterly executive meeting.”</p>
      
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_eip-197">John was delighted with being made the project manager. The B2B project was the largest BizNex Inc. had ever implemented, and the order processing subproject was one component of the larger B2B project. </p><p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169346066787">Once developed, the B2B system would enable BizNex Inc. to establish seamless connections with its vendors. Although BizNex Inc. already used computers in its order processing system, the bulk of transactions entailed manual interventions. This caused the order fulfillment function to operate slowly and led to errors because the manual interventions were error prone. With the new B2B system, customers would enter orders using the internet. Once captured by the B2B e-commerce system, the orders would be processed entirely by the computer.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169342515830">This project provided John with his first real management experience. He was hired by BizNex Inc. straight after completing his MBA degree at Rice University. During his first two years at BizNex Inc., he was assistant to Mike Johnson, Vice President of Operations. Despite the high profile of his job and the exposure it gave him to high-level decision making within the company, John felt that he wanted to become more involved in the decision making process. With the order processing subproject, he was being given something tangible to do with significantly more responsibilities.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337378287">John determined to do a good job on his project. He put together a task list. From his experiences since leaving college he knew it was important to assemble the "Project Staff.” After careful thought he decided he needed a business analyst, a procurement specialist, an internet expert, an e-commerce expert, a logistics expert, and a representative from each of the company’s five divisions. He figured that he and the business analyst would be the only full time resources on the project. However, the other team members would need to make a fairly substantial commitments to the project if it is to be completed in a month. He decided that each would have to dedicate 25% of their time to the project.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169341240610">Since there would be five divisions represented, John planned that each of the five divisional representatives would write a section of the study, detailing the impacts of the order processing system on their operations and defining whatever order processing needs they have. The business analyst would capture and document the business requirements and write the technical portions of the report. John’s function would be to coordinate the efforts of the others and to integrate all the pieces into a cohesive plan.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337368045">As John started to put his team together, he immediately ran into trouble: he was unable to get a business analyst assigned full time to the project. Because his division was in the midst of developing the B2B system, all business analysts were already over committed. John went to his boss, Mike, with his problem, but was simply told that he would just have to make do with the resources available on a day-to-day basis. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169341323514">John thought his luck was changing when he tried to obtain the procurement specialist for his project. After several enquiries someone told him he should talk with Doug Black, who worked in the contracts and procurement department. Doug was two months away from retirement so his workload was being reduced. John reasoned that one month assignment on his project would fit in with the plans to ease Doug into retirement. As a consequence Doug was assigned full time to the project to help pick up the slack of not have a business analyst on the project.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337367842">John next approached the information resource manager located in the Information Technology division and told him of his need for an internet specialist and e-commerce expert. The resource manager immediately assigned Sara Stone to help John with internet matters. Unfortunately, with no internal e-commerce system experience, John was told that he would have to go to an outside consultant for the e-commerce expertise needed. 
</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337377886">The varying degrees of success John had had so far continued when he tried to recruit the representatives from the different divisions. The vice president of the information technology (IT) division, Sam Nelson, was nothing like what he hoped for. His request for assistance was met with an uncomfortable silence. A clearly upset Sam said, “I don’t fully understand why you and Mike are playing the lead role on something like this. Building an order processing system is basically an information technology chore and should be left to the IT experts. I’ve had my team looking into the matter of automating the order processing system for months, and now you come in here telling me what to do.” He dismissed John saying that he would "look into things personally." John noted that he had specifically not indicated that he would provide any cooperation. In contrast, John had a good reception from the finance division; the vice president of finance, Lynn Waters, announced it was about time BizNex Inc. entered into the twenty-first century and said she would be glad to assign someone from her office to help John on the project. </p>
      
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169341273321">Until now, all of his experience at BizNex Inc. had been quite friendly, this was a side of the business he had not seen before. As he got back to his office, he didn't have any time to consider the implications because Doug Black knocked on his door. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169341529879">“Listen John,” Doug said rather sheepishly. “As you know, I have just under two months until I am out of here. I’d like to help you on this project of yours, really I would. I am sure it is important. But let me say I really don’t know much about computers and think order processing is horridly dull. I don't see why I should put too much effort into something that won't effect me. So while I'll work with you, you won't expect too much will you?”</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169342674224">All of this happened on the Thursday, just three days into the project. To get the project moving, John tried to arrange a kick-off meeting of all project staff at nine o’clock the following Monday. Since Sam Nelson’s office (IT) had not assigned a representative, it would not be represented. The finance division representative said he thought it was a great idea, but he would be out of town throughout the week so could not attend. The other project staff members said they would attend the meeting, but John got the impression they were not happy about it. Only Sara Stone, the internet expert, sounded interested. John wasn’t sure what he would do about getting the e-commerce expert. He would have to talk to Mike Johnson about it.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169342526847">All through the weekend, John prepared for the meeting. He put together a five page preliminary position paper, identified milestones the team members would have to meet, created guidelines for the activities to be undertaken and read several journal articles on Internet Technology and online order processing. On Monday at nine o’clock, John arrived in the conference room and found it empty. By nine-thirty, only two other project team members had shown up. Conspicuously absent were Doug Black and Sara Stone, both of whom had assured him they would be there. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169342798412">Without accomplishing anything, John closed the meeting and returned to his office. On his voicemail he found a message from Sara Stone saying that she was sorry to have missed the meeting, but her boss in the information resources management department (part of the IT division) had told her that he was pulling her off the project. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169346028220">About an hour later, Mike Johnson called John into his office to tell him that he was putting the order processing automation project on hold. He said, “Sam went to the CEO and complained that you and I are a couple of cowboys, and were running around doing things we had no business doing." Mike seemed resigned, and continued, "Sorry John. You win some and lose some. Next time we’ll do better right?”</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_eip-916">John mumbled assent then went back to his own office. Closing the door he sat at his desk and stared out of the window. What had he done wrong, and why had someone told the company CEO that he was some kind of amateur. As the implications of this last week settled in, John wondered about his future with BizNex Inc.</p>

    <section data-depth="1" id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169341336651"><h3 data-type="title">So what went wrong? </h3>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169341675967">The story above is not an isolated incident. Every day, scientists, engineers, salespeople, technicians, and countless others are thrust into the role of project manager. They're very good at what they do. In fact, they're typically the most technically knowledgeable engineers or the most successful salespeople. Now they're about to become project managers. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169342474727">Actually it's probably appropriate to refer to them by their more popular name: <em data-effect="italics">accidental project managers</em>. An accidental project manager is a person who is placed into the role by organizational necessity and chance, rather than by design or through choice of career path. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169342688622">If you're an accidental project manager, one of the first things you should do is pause to consider whether or not you're cut out to be a project manager and try to determine whether it's what you really want to do. Why? Because if you do a reasonably good job leading your first project, chances are you'll be asked again. And again. And again. In other words, if you're finding yourself in the same position as John, you might be embarking upon a new career. You'd be wise to consider some of the pros and cons before saying yes to that career move. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337378304">The information, tools, and techniques described in this course will move you well along in understanding the mechanics of managing projects. But it's important that you enter this new world with your eyes wide open. With that thought in mind, let's take a closer look at what you might expect to experience as a project manager.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169341546980">However John may feel about taking on his first project, the truth is that life as a project manager can be extremely rewarding. You'll find it to be different from almost any other thing you've ever done. It's complex, varied, and interesting. If done well, it can lead to a very strong sense of accomplishment. These are among the aspects that project managers identify as the main draws to the job. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337329452">At the same time, being a project manager will test you in ways you may not be able to imagine. You will become a focal point in the organization especially on high profile projects. Everyone will look to you for the answers, but you must be careful not to try to provide all the answers; after all, that's why you have a team. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337329459">Speaking of the <em data-effect="italics">team</em>, one of the biggest shifts in behavior (and thinking) you'll encounter will be the need to rely upon others to get things done. In most cases, that's your team. You'll quickly discover that there's far too much for you to do alone, yet delegation will prove to be a challenge for you. Empowering others, and then trusting them to follow through, may be a bit unsettling. You'll find yourself uncomfortable with the idea that others are doing things for which you will be held responsible. You'll have lots of responsibility, but you'll be missing the authority often perceived as being required to discharge that responsibility. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337329888">John was given the responsibility for getting the job done but had very little authority to see to it that his decisions were implemented. This was reflected in his problems in recruiting project team members and evidenced in the fact that he could exercise only marginal control over Doug Black, the procurement specialist <em data-effect="italics">and</em> the only other full time member. Project professionals typically have little authority to carry out their work. They have little or no direct control over those people and things that make the difference between project success and failure. Among your most valued tools will be the ability to persuade and influence, as you seek to form a group of diverse personalities into a unified team with commonalty of purpose. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337377759">Unfortunately, not everyone on your team will be as knowledgeable and skilled as you would like. Nonetheless, you've got to get the job done using whatever resources have been provided. Project manager’s staff is generally on temporary loan to them. This is also true of the material resources needed for the success of the project. People with specialized skills often work on the individual pieces. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169346198104">On the B2B sub-project in this story, the team was structured in such a way that most of the members would bring their own specialized skills to the project, e.g., knowledge of e-commerce, knowledge of the workings of the procurement division, internet/technical skills. Often, though, skills are so specialized that they are employed only briefly. It is not at all uncommon to have the composition of the project team continually changing as the project progresses through its life cycle.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169341234362">So as long as project professionals are dealing with borrowed resources, they have limited control over them. This reality overwhelmed John. The case study is full of instances in which he was incapable of getting people to do what he needs to have done.</p>
      <ul id="eip-634"><li>He couldn’t get a business analyst assigned full time to his project.</li>
<li>His full time resource, Doug, made it clear that he is just treading water until his retirement and doesn’t even show up for the kick off meeting. </li>
<li>Jerry finds a competent colleague in Sara Stone, the internet expert; but due to the political dynamics of the situation, she is pulled off the project by her boss. </li>
<li>BizNex Inc. doesn’t have an e-commerce expert so he will have to hire an outside consultant over whom he may not be able to exercise some degree of control.</li>

</ul>
      
      
      
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169347299507">From John’s perspective, the problem is that although he is the project manager, he is not the boss. This would be highly impractical, to be boss, John would have to possess control over the career development of all the people on working on the project, and in view of the nature of his small project, highly impractical.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337367982">Project management lore is full of tales of project managers who were able to take <em data-effect="italics">the hand that was dealt</em> and turn it into project success. For you to succeed, you'll have to rely on your ability to coach, mentor, and motivate, in order to get the level of performance you need from those assigned to work on your project. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337365434">What will you have to know as a project manager? Well, you'll have to know a little bit about just about everything. You'll have to learn to pay attention to the details, but not get wrapped up in them. You'll have to make countless decisions with insufficient information and despite conflicting signals. You'll have to condition yourself to seek <em data-effect="italics">acceptable</em> solutions, rather than <em data-effect="italics">perfect</em> ones. You'll have to blend technical expertise with a keen sense of human nature. You'll have to handle administrative matters. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337367993">While you're busy doing your own thing, you'll have to cultivate and maintain a smooth working relationship with many other people, both inside and outside your organization. Unfortunately, as you seek to carry out the objectives of the project, it's unlikely that everyone you encounter will be an ally. Organizational politics and reality dictate that not everyone will like project management or project managers (that's you!). Many people will admire your role, respect your position, and appreciate your involvement; others will not. You will need to figure out who's who, really fast. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337378501">One final word on John’s unfortunate adventure; a substantial share of his problems are rooted by his lack of experience. For example, he does nothing to strengthen his authority. Rather than go out on his own in dealing with people in other departments at BizNex Inc., he should have worked through his vice president, Mike Johnson. He could have drafted an e-mail, sent by Mr. Johnson that explained the purpose of his inquiries. In this way, he would not have looked like a loose cannon. Because John dealt directly with vice presidents in the company, it isn’t really surprising that the information technology vice president saw John’s actions as an infringement on his territory.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337367812">Project management is both an art and a science. The art is strongly tied to the interpersonal aspects; the business of leading people. The science includes understanding of processes, tools and techniques. All project managers are expected to be very well versed in the science of project management. You cannot survive without being knowledgeable in this area. </p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169347304540">We will be addressing the overall project context, encompassing people, teams and the organization. We’ll look at how organizational issues can lead to project success or failures and the central importance of politics in projects. We’ll talk about strategies on how to cope with these and other realities. We’ll talk about project planning and control and defining the needs and requirements analysis, we’ll review some standard tools used for enhancing planning and control and finally how to successfully close out a project.</p>
      <p id="auto_9d8855fb-8541-489a-ad46-4736ab83997e_id1169337319280">Although we'll focus primarily upon the process, we'll never lose sight of the importance of the interpersonal aspects as well as the environmental aspects; the people and things that surround your project. </p>

    <p id="auto_2a1cdb40-6136-4636-9512-1fb800d18679_id9658605">Could the Great Wall of China, the pyramids, or Stonehenge (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_2a1cdb40-6136-4636-9512-1fb800d18679_id7445699">[link]</a>) have been built without project management? It is possible to say that the concept of project management has been around since the beginning of history. It has enabled leaders to plan bold and massive projects and manage funding, materials and labor within a designated time frame. </p>

Suddenly, business leaders found themselves faced with the daunting task of organizing the manual labor of thousands of workers and the processing and assembly of unprecedented quantities of raw material. </p>

A Gantt chart is a popular type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule and have become a common technique for representing the phases and activities of a project work breakdown structure, so they can be understood by a wide audience (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_2a1cdb40-6136-4636-9512-1fb800d18679_id18438546">[link]</a>). Although now considered a common charting technique, Gantt charts were considered quite revolutionary at the time they were introduced. Gantt charts were employed on major infrastructure projects including the Hoover Dam and the Interstate highway system and are still accepted today as an important tool in project.</p>

    <p id="auto_2a1cdb40-6136-4636-9512-1fb800d18679_id13365404">By the mid Twentieth century, projects were managed on an <em data-effect="italics">ad hoc</em> basis using mostly Gantt Charts, and informal techniques and tools. During that time, the Manhattan project was initiated and its complexity was only possible because of project management methods. The Manhattan project was the codename given to the Allied effort to develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. It involved over thirty different project sites in the US and Canada, and thousands of personnel from US, Canada and UK. Born out of a small research program that began in 1939, the Manhattan Project would eventually employ 130,000 people and cost a total of nearly 2 billion USD and result in the creation of multiple production and research sites operated in secret. The project succeeded in developing and detonating three nuclear weapons in 1945. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_2a1cdb40-6136-4636-9512-1fb800d18679_id12734563">The 1950s marked the beginning of the modern Project Management era. Two mathematical project-scheduling models were developed: </p>
    
    
    
    <ol id="id17666117" type="1"><li>The <em data-effect="italics">Program Evaluation and Review Technique</em> or PERT, developed by Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton as part of the United States Navy’s (in conjunction with the Lockheed Corporation) Polaris missile submarine program. Pert is basically a method for analyzing the tasks involved for completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and identifying the minimum time needed to complete the total project (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_2a1cdb40-6136-4636-9512-1fb800d18679_id16904659">[link]</a>).</li>
      <li>The <em data-effect="italics">Critical Path Method</em> (CPM) developed in a joint venture by both DuPont Corporation and Remington Rand Corporation for managing plant maintenance projects. The critical path determines the float, or schedule flexibility, for each activity by calculating the earliest start date, earliest finish date, latest start date, and latest finish date for each activity. The critical path is generally the longest full path on the project. Any activity with a float time that equals zero is considered a critical path task. CPM can help you figure out how long your complex project will take to complete and which activities are critical; meaning they have to be done on time or else the whole project will take longer. These mathematical techniques quickly spread into many private enterprises.</li>

    <p id="auto_2a1cdb40-6136-4636-9512-1fb800d18679_id19047510">Project management in its present form began to take root a few decades ago. In the early 1960s, industrial and business organizations began to understand the benefits of organizing work around projects. They understood the critical need to communicate and integrate work across multiple departments and professions. </p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_2a1cdb40-6136-4636-9512-1fb800d18679_id16781531">The Project Management Institute (PMI) was founded in 1969 by five volunteers. Their initial goal was to establish an organization where members could share their experiences in project management and to discuss issues. Today, PMI is a non-profit project management professional association and the most widely recognized organization in terms of promoting project management best practices. PMI was formed to serve the interests of the project management industry. The premise of PMI is that the tools and techniques of project management are common even among the widespread application of projects from the software to the construction industry. PMI first began offering the PMP certification exam in 1984. Although it took a while for people to take notice, now more than 260,000 individuals around the world hold the PMP designation. </p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_2a1cdb40-6136-4636-9512-1fb800d18679_id9500970">To help keep project management terms and concepts clear and consistent, PMI introduced the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide in 1987. They updated it in 1996, 2000, 2004, and most recently in 2009 as the fourth edition. At present, there are more than 1 million copies of the PMBOK Guide in circulation. The highly regarded Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) have adopted it as their project management standard. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_2a1cdb40-6136-4636-9512-1fb800d18679_id11431056">In 1999 PMI was accredited as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards developer and also has the distinction of being the first organization to have its certification program attain International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 recognition. In 2008, the organization reported more than 260,000 members in over 171 countries. PMI also has offices in Washington, D.C., and Beijing, China, as well as Regional Service Centers in Singapore, Brussels (Belgium) and New Delhi (India). Recently, an office was opened in Mumbai (India). </p>

    <p id="auto_6036105a-3716-482e-9f5d-ffa3fb69b1d3_id4956270">The starting point in discussing how projects should be properly managed is to first understand <em data-effect="italics">what a project is</em> and just as importantly <em data-effect="italics">what it is not</em>. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_6036105a-3716-482e-9f5d-ffa3fb69b1d3_id3045425">People have been undertaking projects since the earliest days of organized human activity. The hunting parties of our prehistoric ancestors were projects for example; they were temporary undertakings directed at the goal of obtaining meat for the community. Large complex projects have also been with us for a long time. The pyramids and the Great Wall of China, were in their day of roughly the same dimensions as the Apollo Project to send man to the moon. We use the term project frequently in our daily conversations. A husband, for example may tell his wife, “My main project for this weekend is to straighten out the garage.” Going hunting, building pyramids, and fixing faucets all share certain features that make them projects.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_6036105a-3716-482e-9f5d-ffa3fb69b1d3_id3791890">A project has distinctive attributes, which distinguish it from ongoing work or business operations. Projects are temporary in nature. They are not an everyday business process and have definitive start dates and end dates. This characteristic is important because a large part of the project effort is dedicated to ensuring that the project is completed at the appointed time. To do this, schedules are created showing when tasks should begin and end. Projects can last minutes, hours, days, weeks, months or years. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_6036105a-3716-482e-9f5d-ffa3fb69b1d3_id1168938876956">Projects exist to bring about a product or service that hasn’t existed before. In this sense, a project is unique. Unique means that this is new, this has never been done before. Maybe it’s been done in a very similar fashion before but never exactly in this way. For example, Ford Motor Company is in the business of designing and assembling cars. Each model that Ford designs and produces can be considered a project. The models differ from each other in their features and are marketed to people with various needs. An SUV serves a different purpose and clientele than a luxury model. The design and marketing of these two models are unique projects. However the actual assembly of the cars is considered an operation, i.e., a repetitive process that is followed for most makes and models.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_6036105a-3716-482e-9f5d-ffa3fb69b1d3_id7666804">In contrast with projects, operations are ongoing and repetitive. They involve work that is continuous without an ending date and you often repeat the same processes and produce the same results. The purpose of operations is to keep the organization functioning while the purpose of a project is to meet its goals and to conclude. Therefore, operations are ongoing while projects are unique and temporary. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_6036105a-3716-482e-9f5d-ffa3fb69b1d3_id8475809">The project is completed when its goals and objectives are accomplished. It is these goals that drive the project and all the planning and implementation efforts are undertaken to achieve them. Sometimes projects end when it’s determined that the goals and objectives cannot be accomplished or when the product or service of the project is no longer needed and the project is cancelled. </p><section data-depth="1" id="auto_6036105a-3716-482e-9f5d-ffa3fb69b1d3_eip-432"><h3 data-type="title">A formal definition of a project</h3><p id="auto_6036105a-3716-482e-9f5d-ffa3fb69b1d3_eip-388">There are many written definitions of a project, however, all of them contain the key elements described above. For those looking for a formal definition of a project the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) defines a project as <em data-effect="italics">a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result. The temporary nature of projects indicates a definite beginning and end. The end is reached when the project’s objectives have been achieved or when the project is terminated because its objectives will not or cannot be met, or when the need for the project no longer exists</em>.</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="auto_6036105a-3716-482e-9f5d-ffa3fb69b1d3_eip-317"><h3 data-type="title">Bibliography</h3><ul id="eip-358"><li>J.

    <p id="auto_df301a1c-8249-4ee4-80d9-06ef19f28b37_id8259279">When considering whether or not you have a project on your hands, there are some things to keep in mind. First, is it a project or ongoing operation? Next, if it is a project; who are the stakeholders? And third, what characteristics distinguish this endeavor as a project?</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_df301a1c-8249-4ee4-80d9-06ef19f28b37_id6684014">A project has several characteristics:</p>
    
    
    
    <ul id="id1164268307184"><li>Projects are unique.</li>
      <li>Projects are temporary in nature and have a definite beginning and ending date.</li>
      <li>Projects are completed when the project goals are achieved or it’s determined the project is no longer viable.</li>
      <li>A successful project is one that meets or exceeds the expectations of your stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_df301a1c-8249-4ee4-80d9-06ef19f28b37_id1164270159895">Consider the following scenario: The VP of marketing approaches you with a fabulous idea. (Obviously it must be “fabulous” because he thought of it.) He wants to set up kiosks in local grocery stores as mini offices. These offices will offer customers the ability to sign up for car and home insurance services as well as make their bill payments. He believes that the exposure in grocery stores will increase awareness of the company’s offerings. He told you that senior management has already cleared the project and he’ll dedicate as many resources to this as he can. He wants the new kiosks in place in 12 selected stores in a major city by the end of the year. Finally, he has assigned you to head up this project.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_df301a1c-8249-4ee4-80d9-06ef19f28b37_id1164267871356">Your first question should be “Is it a project?” This may seem elementary, but confusing projects with ongoing operations happens often. Projects are temporary in nature, have definite start and end dates, result in the creation of a unique product or service, and are completed when their goals and objectives have been met and signed off by the stakeholders.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_df301a1c-8249-4ee4-80d9-06ef19f28b37_id4410896">Using these criteria, let’s examine the assignment from the VP of marketing to determine if it is a project:</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_df301a1c-8249-4ee4-80d9-06ef19f28b37_id8038473"><strong data-effect="bold">Is it unique?</strong> Yes, because the kiosks don’t exist in the local grocery stores. This is a new way of offering the company’s services to its customer base. While the service the company is offering isn’t new, the way it is presenting its services is.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_df301a1c-8249-4ee4-80d9-06ef19f28b37_id1164274776984"><strong data-effect="bold">Does the product have a limited timeframe?</strong> Yes, the start date of this project is today, and the end date is the end of next year. It is a temporary endeavor.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_df301a1c-8249-4ee4-80d9-06ef19f28b37_id8827356"><strong data-effect="bold">Is there a way to determine when the project is completed?</strong> Yes, the kiosks will be installed and the services will be offered from them. Once all the kiosks are intact and operating, the project will come to a close.</p>

    <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171796932818">A project is successful when it achieves its objectives and meets or exceeds the expectations of the stakeholders. But who are the stakeholders? Stakeholders are individuals who either care about or have a vested interest in your project. They are the people who are actively involved with the work of the project or have something to either gain or lose as a result of the project. When you manage a project to add lanes to a highway, motorists are stakeholders who are positively affected. However, you negatively affect residents who live near the highway during your project (with construction noise) and after your project with far reaching implications (increased traffic noise and pollution).</p>
    
    
    
    <div data-type="note" id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_eip-455">Key stakeholders can make or break the success of a project. Even if all the deliverables are met and the objectives are satisfied, if your key stakeholders aren’t happy, nobody’s happy.</div>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171797020123">The project sponsor, generally an executive in the organization with the authority to assign resources and enforce decisions regarding the project, is a stakeholder. The customer, subcontractors, suppliers and sometimes even the Government are stakeholders. The project manager, project team members and the managers from other departments in the organization are stakeholders as well. It’s important to identify all the stakeholders in your project upfront. If you leave out an important stakeholder or their department’s function and don’t discover the error until well into the project, it could be a project killer.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171800754686"><a class="autogenerated-content" href="# id1171798679730 ">[link]</a> shows a sample of the project environment featuring the different kinds of stakeholders involved on a typical project. A study of this diagram confronts us with a couple of interesting facts.</p>
    
    
    
    <ul id="id1171796901216">
      <li>First, the number of stakeholders that project managers must deal with assures that they will have a complex job guiding their project through the lifecycle. Problems with any of these members can derail the project.</li>
      <li>The diagram also shows that project managers have to deal with people external to the organization as well as the internal environment, certainly more complex than what a manager in an internal environment faces. For example, suppliers who are late in delivering crucial parts may blow the project schedule. To compound the problem, project managers generally have little or no direct control over any of these individuals.</li>
    </ul>

      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171799036438">Top management may include the president of the company, vice presidents, directors, division managers, the corporate operating committee, and others. These people direct the strategy and development of the organization. </p>
      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171800138876">On the plus side, you more likely to have top management support, which means it will be easier to recruit the best staff to carry out the project, and to acquire needed material and resources; also visibility can enhance PM’s professional standing in the company. </p>
      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171796884633">On the minus side, failure can be quite dramatic and visible to all, and if the project is large and expensive (most are) the cost of failure will be more substantial than for a smaller less visible project.</p>
      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id5873561">Some suggestions in dealing with top management are:</p>
      <ul id="id1171796932739">
        <li>Develop in-depth plans and major milestones that must be approved by top management during the design phase of the project.</li>
        <li>Ask top management associated with your project for their information reporting needs and frequency.</li>
        <li>Develop a status reporting methodology to be distributed on a scheduled basis.</li>
        <li>Keep them informed of project risks and potential impacts at all times.</li>

      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171796915564">Your project team available to project managers on their project or borrowed rather than assigned to the project on a full time basis. As project manager you need to provide leadership, direction and above all, the support to team members as they go about accomplishing their tasks. Working closely with the team to solve problems can help you learn from the team and build rapport. Showing your support for the project team and for each member will help you get their support and cooperation.</p>
      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171796932589">Some difficulties in dealing with project team members include: </p>
      <ul id="id1171797019816">
        <li>Since project team members are borrowed and they don’t report to you, their priorities may be elsewhere.</li>
        <li>They may be juggling many projects as well as their full time job and have difficulty meeting any deadline. </li>
        <li>Personality conflicts may arise. These may be cause by differences in social style or values or they may be the result of some bad experience when people worked together in the past.</li>
        <li>You may find out about missed deadlines when it is too late to recover.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171796920792">Managing project team members requires interpersonal skills. Here are some suggestions that can help: </p>
      <ul id="id1171796933647">
        <li>Involve team members in project planning. </li>
        <li>Arrange to meet privately and informally with each team member at several points in the project, perhaps for lunch or coffee. </li>
        <li>Be available to hear team members concerns at any time.</li>
        <li>Encourage team members to pitch in and help others when needed.</li>
        <li>Complete a project performance review for team members. </li>

      <ul id="id1171796945543">
        <li>If things go wrong on a project, it is nice to have an understanding and supportive boss to go to bat for us if necessary. By supporting your manager, you will find your manager will support you more often.</li>
        <li>Find out exactly how your performance will be measured. </li>
        <li>When unclear about directions, ask for clarification. </li>

      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171808290564">Peers are people on the project team who are at the same level in the organization as you. These people will, in fact, also have a vested interest in the product. However, they will have neither the leadership responsibilities nor the accountability for the success or failure of the project that you have. </p>
      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171797909593">Your relationship with peers can be impeded by:</p>
      <ul id="id1171802124504"><li>Inadequate control over peers.</li>
        <li>Political maneuvering or sabotage.</li>
        <li>Personality conflict or technical conflict.</li>
        <li>Envy because your peer may have wanted to lead the project.</li>

      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171796932596">Peer support is essential. Because most of us serve our self-interest first, use some investigating, selling, influencing and politicking skills here. To ensure you have cooperation and support from your peers:</p>
      <ul id="id1171802495983"><li>Get the support of your project sponsor or top management to empower you as the project manager with as much authority as possible. It’s important that the sponsor makes it clear to the other team members that their cooperation on project activities is expected.</li>
        <li>Confront your peer if you notice a behavior that seems dysfunctional, such as bad-mouthing the project.</li>
        <li>Be explicit in asking for full support from your peers. </li>
        <li>Arrange for frequent review meetings.</li>
        <li>Establish goals and standards of performance for all team members.</li>

      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171796916675">Because project managers are in the position of borrowing resources, other managers control their resources. So their relationships with people are especially important. If their relationship is good, they may be able to consistently acquire the best staff and the best equipment for their projects. If relations aren’t so good, they may find themselves not able to get good people or equipment needed on the project.</p>

      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171796927569">Internal customers are individuals within the organization who have projects that meet the needs of internal demands. The customer holds the power to accept or reject your work. Early in the relationship, the project manager will need to negotiate, clarify, and document project specifications and deliverables. After the project begins, the project manager must stay tuned in to the customer’s concerns and issues and keep the customer informed. </p>
      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id6753556">Common stumbling blocks when dealing with customers include:</p>

        <li>A lack of clarity about precisely what is wanted by the customer. </li>
        <li>A lack of documentation for what is wanted. </li>
        <li>A lack of knowledge of the customer’s organization and operating characteristics. </li>
        <li>Unrealistic deadlines, budgets, or specifications. </li>
        <li>Hesitancy to sign off on the project or accept responsibility for decisions. </li>

      <ul id="id1171797025534">
        <li>Learn the client’s organization’s buzzwords, culture, and business. </li>
        <li>Clarify all project requirements and specifications in a written agreement. </li>

      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id8014588">There are times when organizations don’t have the expertise in house or available resources and work is farmed out to contractors or subcontractors. This can be a construction management firm, network consultants, electricians, carpenters, architects, and in general anyone who is not an employee. Managing contractors or suppliers requires many of the skills needed to manage full-time project team members. </p>
      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171796942117">Any number of problems can arise with contractors or subcontractors: </p>
      <ul id="id1171796914767">
        <li>Quality of the work. </li>
        <li>Cost overruns. </li>
        <li>Schedule slippage. </li>

      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171796932674">Many projects heavily depend on goods provided by outside suppliers. This is true for example of construction projects where lumber, nails, brick and mortar come from outside suppliers. </p>
      <ul id="id1171796931439">
        <li>If the supplied goods are delivered late or in short supply or of poor quality or if the price is greater than originally quoted, the project may suffer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="auto_ea8e7e41-8d0f-4d49-aa22-f801f203ddfa_id1171797020417">Depending on the project, managing relationships can consume more than half of the project manager’s time. It is not purely intuitive; it involves a sophisticated skill set that includes managing conflicts, negotiating, and other interpersonal skills.</p>

    <p id="auto_c61a626f-a979-45c1-ac93-d9b7dac8386a_id3078234">Many times, project stakeholders have conflicting interests. It’s the project manager’s responsibility to understand these conflicts and try to resolve them. It’s also the project manger’s responsibility to manage stakeholder expectations. Be certain to identify and meet with all key stakeholders early in the project to understand all their needs and constraints. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_c61a626f-a979-45c1-ac93-d9b7dac8386a_id1166208955956">Project managers are somewhat like politicians. Typically, they are not inherently powerful, or capable of imposing their will directly to co-workers, subcontractors and suppliers. Like politicians, if they are to get their way, they have to exercise influence effectively over others. On projects, project managers have direct control over very few things; therefore their ability to influence others- to be a good politician- may be very important</p>

The notes you scribbled down on the back of the napkin at lunch are a start, but not exactly good project management practice. Too often, organizations follow Nike’s advice when it comes to managing projects when they “just do it.” An assignment is made and the project team members jump directly into the development of the product or service requested. In the end the delivered product doesn’t meet the expectations of the customer. Unfortunately, many projects follow this poorly constructed path and that is a primary contributor to why a large percentage of projects don’t meet their original objectives defined by performance, schedule, and budget. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id1165248220710">In the United States, more than $250 billion dollars is spent each year on IT application development in approximately 175,000 projects. The Standish Group (a Boston-based leader in project and value performance research) just released the summary version of their 2009 CHAOS Report that tracks project failure rates across a broad range of companies and industries (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="# id7425309 ">[link]</a>). </p>

The vast majority of this waste is completely avoidable; simply get the right business needs (requirements) understood early in the process and ensure that project management techniques are applied and followed and the project activities are monitored. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id1165250040962">Applying good project management discipline is the way to help reduce the risks. But keep in mind, having good project management skills does not mean you have no problems, it does not mean that risks go away, or that there won’t be any surprises. The value of good project management is that you have standard processes in place to deal with all contingencies.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id1165249484453">Project Management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques applied to project activities in order to meet the project requirements. Project management is a process that includes planning, putting the project plan into action, and measuring progress and performance. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id1165248504456">Managing a project includes identifying your project’s requirements; writing down what everyone needs from the project. What are the objectives for your project? When everyone understands the goal, it’s much easier to keep them all on the right path. Make sure you set goals that everyone agrees on to avoid team conflicts later on. Understanding and addressing the needs of everyone affected by the project means the end result of your project is far more likely to satisfy your stakeholders, and last but not least, as project manager you will also be balancing the many competing project constraints. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id1165248484629">On any project, you will have a number of competing project constraints that are competing for your attention. They are cost, scope, quality, risk, resources and time. </p>
    
    
    
    <ul id="eip-204"><li><strong data-effect="bold">Cost</strong> is budget approved for the project including all necessary expenses needed to deliver the project. Within organizations, project managers have to balance between not running out of money and not under spending because many projects receive funds or grants that have contract clauses with an “use it or lose it” approach to project funds. Poorly executed budget plans can result in a last minute rush to spend the allocated funds. For virtually all projects, cost is ultimately a limiting constraint; few projects can go over budget without eventually requiring a corrective action.</li>

<li><strong data-effect="bold">Scope</strong>  is what the project is trying to achieve, it entails all the work involved in delivering the projects outcomes and the processes used to produce them. It is the reason and the purpose of the project. </li>

<li><strong data-effect="bold">Quality</strong> is the standards and criteria to which the project’s products must be delivered for them to perform effectively. First, the product must perform to provide the functionality expected, and to solve the problem, and deliver the benefit and value expected of it. It must also meet other performance requirements, or service levels, such as availability, reliability and maintainability, and have acceptable finish and polish. Quality on a project is controlled through quality assurance (QA) that is the process of evaluating overall project’s performance on a regular basis to provide confidence that the project will satisfy the relevant quality standards.</li>

<li><strong data-effect="bold">Risk</strong> is defined by potential external events that will have a negative impact on your project if they occur. Risk refers to the combination of the probability the event will occur and the impact on the project if the event occurs. If the combination of the probability of the occurrence and the impact to the project is too high, you should identify the potential event as a risk and put a proactive plan in place to manage the risk. </li>

<li><strong data-effect="bold">Resources</strong> are required to carry out the project tasks. They can be people, equipment, facilities, funding, or anything else capable of definition (usually other than labor) required for the completion of a project activity.</li>

<li><strong data-effect="bold">Time</strong> is defined as the time to complete the project. Time is often the most frequent project oversight in developing projects. This is reflected in missed deadlines and incomplete deliverables. Proper control of the schedule requires the careful identification of tasks to be performed, an accurate estimation of their durations, the sequence in which they are going to be done, and how people and other resources are allocated.</li>

</ul>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id2579093">You may have heard of the term “Triple Constraint” which traditionally only consisted of <em data-effect="italics">Time</em>, <em data-effect="italics">Cost</em> &amp; <em data-effect="italics">Scope</em>. These are the primary competing project constraints that you have to be aware of most. The triple constraint is illustrated in the form of a triangle to visualize the project work and to see the relationship between the scope/quality, schedule/time, and cost/resource (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id1165249151944">[link]</a>). </p>

    <p id="auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id1165249151993">In this triangle, each side represents one of the constraints (or related constraints) wherein any changes to any one side cause a change in the other sides. The best projects have a perfectly balanced triangle. Maintaining this balance is difficult because projects are prone to change. For example, if scope increases, cost and time may increase disproportionately. Alternatively, if the amount of money you have for your project decreases, you may be able to do as much, but your time may increase. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id1165248612314">Your project may have additional constraints that you are facing, and as the project manager you have to balance the needs of these constraints against the needs of the stakeholders and against your project goals. For instance, if your sponsor wants to add functionality to the original scope you will very likely need more money to finish the project or if they cut the budget you have to reduce the quality of your scope and if you don’t get the appropriate resources to work on your project tasks you will have to extend your schedule because the resources you have take much longer to finish the work. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id1165247911048">You get the idea; they are all dependent on each other. Think of all of these constraints as the classic carnival game of Whac-a-mole (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_f0a795f0-0309-43f1-b93c-eb772e5d4c5d_id1165247981636">[link]</a>). Each time you try to push one mole back in the hole, another one pops out. The best advice is to rely on your project team to keep these moles in place! </p>

    <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10120350">In order for you as the project manager to manage the competing project constraints and to manage the project as a whole, there are some areas of expertise that you should bring onto the project team (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id7287660">[link]</a>). They are the application area of knowledge; standards and regulations in your industry, understanding the project environment, and you must have general management knowledge and interpersonal skills. It should be noted that the industry expertise is not in a certain field but the expertise in order to run the project. So while knowledge of the type of industry is important you will have a project team supporting you in this endeavor. For example, if you are managing a project that is building an oil platform, you would not be expected to have a detailed understanding of the engineering since your team will have mechanical and civil engineers who will provide the appropriate expertise, however, it would definitely help if you understand this type of work. </p>

      <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id5318187">By <em data-effect="italics">standards</em>, we mean guidelines or preferred approaches that are not necessarily mandatory. In contrast, when referring to <em data-effect="italics">regulations</em> we mean mandatory rules that must be followed such as Government imposed requirements through laws. It should go without saying that as a professional, you’re required to follow all applicable laws and rules that apply to your industry, organization, or project. Every industry has standards and regulations. Knowing which ones effect your project before you begin work will not only help the project to unfold smoothly, but will also allow for effective risk analysis. </p>
      <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10972506">Some projects require specific skills in certain application areas. Application areas are made up of categories of projects that have common elements. They can be defined by: industry group (pharmaceutical, financial, etc), by department (accounting, marketing, legal, etc), by technical (software development, engineering, etc), or management (procurement, research, &amp; development, etc) specialties. These application areas are usually concerned with disciplines, regulations and the specific needs of the project, the customer, or the industry. For example, most government agencies have specific procurement rules that apply to their projects that wouldn’t be applicable in the construction industry. The pharmaceutical industry is interested in regulations set forth by the Food and Drug Administration, whereas the automotive industry has little or no concern for either of these types of regulations. You need to stay up-to-date regarding your industry so that you can apply your knowledge effectively. Today’s fast paced advances can leave you behind fairly quickly if you don’t stay abreast on current trends.</p>
      <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10849033">Having some level of experience in the application area you’re working in will give you an advantage when it comes to project management. While you can call in experts who have the application area knowledge, it doesn’t hurt for you to understand the specific aspects of the application areas of your project. </p>

      <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id6156818">There are many factors that need to be understood within your project environment (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10654202">[link]</a>). At one level you need to understand your project environment by thinking in terms of the cultural and the social environment. In this region we think of people, demographics and education. The international and political environment is where you need to understand about different countries cultural influences. Then we move on to the physical environment; here we think about time zones, think about different countries and how differently your project will be executed whether it is just in your country or whether you have an international project team that is distributed throughout the world in five different countries. </p>
      <figure id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10654202"><figcaption>The important factors to consider within the project environment.  </figcaption><span data-alt="" data-type="media" id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10654202_media">

      <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10862318">Of all the factors the physical ones are the easiest to understand, and it is the cultural and international factors that are often misunderstood or ignored. How we deal with clients, customers, or project members from other countries can be critical to the success of the project. For example, the culture of the United States values accomplishments and individualism. Americans tend to be informal and call each other by first names, even if having just met. Europeans tend to be more formal, using surnames instead of first names in a business setting, even if they know each other well. In addition, their communication style is more formal than in the US, and while they tend to value individualism, they also value history, hierarchy, and loyalty. The Japanese, on the other hand, tend to communicate indirectly and consider themselves part of a group, not as individuals. The Japanese value hard work and success, as most of us do. </p>
      <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id5169451">How a product is received can be very dependent on the international cultural differences. For example, in the nineties, when many large American and European telecommunications companies were cultivating new markets in Asia, their customer’s cultural differences often produced unexpected situations. Western companies planned their telephone systems to work the same way in Asia as they did in Europe and America. But the protocol of conversation was different. Call-waiting, a popular feature in the West, is considered impolite in some parts of Asia. This cultural blunder could have been avoided had the team captured the project environment requirements and involved the customer. </p>
      <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id11305787">It is often the simplest things that can cause trouble since unsurprisingly in different countries people do things differently. One of the most notorious examples of this is also one of the most simple: date formats. What day and month is 2/8/2009? Of course it depends where you come from; in North America it is February 8<sup>th</sup> while in Europe (and much of the rest of the world) it is 2<sup>nd</sup> August. Clearly, when schedules and deadlines are being defined it is important that everyone is clear on the format used. </p>
      <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id9408423">The diversity of practices and cultures and its impact on products in general and on software in particular, goes well beyond the date issue. You may be managing a project to create a new website for a company that sells products worldwide. There are language and presentation style issues to take into consideration; converting the site into different languages isn’t enough. It is obvious to ensure that the translation is correct, however, the presentation layer will have its own set of requirements for different cultures. The left side of a web site may be the first focus of attention for an American; the right side would be the initial focus for anyone from the Middle East, as both Arabic and Hebrew are written from right to left. Colors also have different meanings in different cultures. White, which is a sign of purity in America (e.g., a bride’s wedding dress), and thus would be a favored background color in North America, signifies death in Japan (e.g., a burial shroud). <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10776978">[link]</a> summarizes different meanings of common colors. </p>

      <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10634318">As the project manager you have to rely on your project management knowledge and your general management skills. In this area we are thinking of items like your ability to plan the project, to execute the project properly and of course to control the project and bring it to a successful conclusion with the ability to guide the project team while achieving project objectives and balancing the project constraints.</p>
      <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id9324229">There is more to project management than just getting the work done. Inherent to the process of project management are the general management skills that allow the project manager to complete the project with some level of efficiency and control. In some respects, managing a project is similar to running a business: there are risk and rewards, finance and accounting activities, human resource issues, time management, stress management, and a purpose for the project to exist. General management skills are needed in just about every project. </p>

        <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10901701">Project managers spend 90% of their time communicating. Therefore they must be good communicators, promoting clear unambiguous exchange of information. As a project manager, it is your job to keep a number of people well informed. It is essential that your project staff know what is expected of them: what they have to do, when they have to do it, and what budget and time constraints and quality specification they are working towards. If project staff does not know what their tasks are, or how to accomplish them, then the entire project will grind to a halt. If you do not know what the project staff is (or often is not) doing then you will be unable to monitor project progress. Finally, if you are uncertain of what the customer expects of you, then the project will not even get off the ground. Project communication can thus be summed up as <em data-effect="italics">who needs what information and when</em>. </p>
        <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10873482">All projects require sound communication plans, but not all projects will have the same types of communication or the same methods for distributing the information. For example, will information be distributed via mail or e-mail, is there a shared web site, or are face-to-face meetings required? The communication management plan documents how the communication needs of the stakeholders will be met, including the types of information that will be communicated, who will communicate it, who receives the communication, the methods used to communicate, the timing and frequency, the method for updating the plan as the project progresses, escalation process, and a glossary of common terms. </p>

        <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id7246492">Project management is about getting things done. Every organization is different in its policies, modes of operations and underlying culture. There are political alliances, differing motivations, conflicting interest, and power struggles within every organization. A project manager must understand all of the unspoken influences at work within an organization.</p>

        <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10087913">Leadership is the ability to motivate and inspire individuals to work towards expected results. Leaders inspire vision and rally people around common goals. A good project manager can motivate and inspire the project team to see the vision and value of the project. The project manager as a leader can inspire the project team to find a solution to overcome the perceived obstacles to get the work done.</p>

        <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id10283521">Motivation helps people work more efficiently and produce better results. Motivation is a constant process that the project manager must have to help the team move towards completion with passion and a profound reason to complete the work. Motivating the team is accomplished by using a variety of team building techniques and exercises. Team building is simply getting a diverse group of people to work together in the most efficient and effective manner possible. This may involve management events as well as individual actions designed to improve team performance. </p>
        <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id4941307">Recognition and rewards are an important part of team motivations. They are formal ways of recognizing and promoting desirable behavior and are most effective when carried out by the management team and the project manager. Consider individual preferences and cultural differences when using rewards and recognition. Some people don’t like to be recognized in front of a group; others thrive on it.</p>

        <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id9424063">Problem solving is the ability to understand the heart of a problem, look for a viable solution, and then make a decision to implement that solution. The premise for problem solving is problem definition. Problem definition is the ability to understand the cause and effect of the problem; this centers on root cause analysis. If a project manager treats only the symptoms of a problem rather than its cause, the symptoms will perpetuate and continue through the project life. Even worse treating a symptom may result in a greater problem. For example, increasing the ampere rating of a fuse in your car because the old one keeps blowing does not solve the problem of an electrical short that could result in a fire. Root cause analysis looks beyond the immediate symptoms to the cause of the symptoms, which then affords opportunities for solutions. Once the root of a problem has been identified, a decision must be made to effectively address the problem. </p>
        <p id="auto_fe70dfb3-79e4-44e9-b365-e6d2d2d1d640_id4361959">Solutions can be presented from vendors, the project team, the project manager or various stakeholders. A viable solution focuses on more than just the problem; it looks at the cause and effect of the solution itself. In addition, a timely decision is needed or the window of opportunity may pass and then a new decision will be needed to address the problem. As in most cases, the worst thing you can do is nothing.</p>

    <p id="auto_4380447a-ad1c-4fa5-b108-e72cf1846575_id11484682">The project manager and project team have one shared goal: to carry out the work of the project for the purpose of meeting the project’s objectives. Every project has beginnings, a middle period during which activities move the project toward completion, and an ending (either successful or unsuccessful). A standard project typically has the following four major phases (each with its own agenda of tasks and issues): <em data-effect="italics">initiation</em>, <em data-effect="italics">planning</em>, <em data-effect="italics">execution</em>, and <em data-effect="italics">closure</em>. Taken together, these phases represent the path a project takes from the beginning to its end and are generally referred to as the project <em data-effect="italics">life cycle</em> (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_4380447a-ad1c-4fa5-b108-e72cf1846575_id7143038">[link]</a>).</p>

      <p id="auto_4380447a-ad1c-4fa5-b108-e72cf1846575_id3094139">During the first of these phases, the <em data-effect="italics">initiation phase</em>, the project objective or need is identified; this can be a business problem or opportunity. An appropriate response to the need is documented in a business case with recommended solution options. A feasibility study is conducted to investigate whether each option addresses the project objective and a final recommended solution is determined. Issues of feasibility (“can we do the project?”) and justification (“should we do the project?”) are addressed. </p>
      <p id="auto_4380447a-ad1c-4fa5-b108-e72cf1846575_id14580683">Once the recommended solution is approved, a project is initiated to deliver the approved solution and a project manager is appointed. The major deliverables and the participating work groups are identified and the project team begins to take shape. Approval is then sought by the project manager to move on the detailed planning phase.</p>

      <p id="auto_4380447a-ad1c-4fa5-b108-e72cf1846575_id8813450">The next phase, the <em data-effect="italics">planning phase</em>, is where the project solution is further developed in as much detail as possible and you plan the steps necessary to meet the project’s objective. In this step, the team identifies all of the work to be done. The project’s tasks and resource requirements are identified, along with the strategy for producing them. This is also referred to as scope management. A project plan is created outlining the activities, tasks, dependencies and timeframes. The project manager coordinates the preparation of a project budget; by providing cost estimates for the labor, equipment and materials costs. The budget is used to monitor and control cost expenditures during project execution. </p>
      <p id="auto_4380447a-ad1c-4fa5-b108-e72cf1846575_id8544046">Once the project team has identified the work, prepared the schedule and estimated the costs, the three fundamental components of the planning process are complete. This is an excellent time to identify and try to deal with anything that might pose a threat to the successful completion of the project. This is called <em data-effect="italics">risk management</em>. In risk management, “high-threat” potential problems are identified along with the action that is to be taken on each high threat potential problem, either to reduce the probability that the problem will occur or to reduce the impact on the project if it does occur. This is also a good time to identify all project stakeholders, and to establish a communication plan describing the information needed and the delivery method to be used to keep the stakeholders informed. </p><p id="auto_4380447a-ad1c-4fa5-b108-e72cf1846575_eip-980">Finally, you will want to document a quality plan; providing quality targets, assurance, and control measures along with an acceptance plan; listing the criteria to be met to gain customer acceptance. At this point, the project would have been planned in detail and is ready to be executed.</p>

      <p id="auto_4380447a-ad1c-4fa5-b108-e72cf1846575_id17707458">During the third phase, the <em data-effect="italics">execution phase</em>, the project plan is put into motion and performs the work of the project. It is important to maintain control and communicate as needed during execution. Progress is continuously monitored and appropriate adjustments are made and recorded as variances from the original plan. In any project a project manager will spend most of their time in this step. During project execution, people are carrying out the tasks and progress information is being reported through regular team meetings. The project manager uses this information to maintain control over the direction of the project by measuring the performance of the project activities comparing the results with the project plan and takes corrective action as needed. The first course of action should always be to bring the project back on course, i.e., to return it to the original plan. If that cannot happen, the team should record variations from the original plan and record and publish modifications to the plan. Throughout this step, project sponsors and other key stakeholders should be kept informed of project status according to the agreed upon frequency and format. The plan should be updated and published on a regular basis (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_4380447a-ad1c-4fa5-b108-e72cf1846575_id554545">[link]</a>). </p>

<p id="auto_4380447a-ad1c-4fa5-b108-e72cf1846575_id17485384">Status reports should always emphasize the anticipated end point in terms of cost, schedule and quality of deliverables. Each project deliverable produced should be reviewed for quality and measured against the acceptance criteria. Once all of the deliverables have been produced and the customer has accepted the final solution, the project is ready for closure.</p>

The last remaining step is to conduct lessons learned studies; to examine what went well and what didn’t. Through this type of analysis the wisdom of experience is transferred back to the project organization, which will help future project teams. </p>

    <p id="auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id1170343913546">The project <em data-effect="italics">initiation phase</em> is the first phase within the project management life cycle, as it involves starting up a new project. Within the initiation phase, the business problem or opportunity is identified, a solution is defined, a project is formed, and a project team is appointed to build and deliver the solution to the customer. A business case is created to define the problem or opportunity in detail and identify a preferred solution for implementation. The business case includes: </p>
    
    
    
    <ul id="id1170343818320">
      <li>A detailed description of the problem or opportunity</li>
      <li>A list of the alternative solutions available</li>
      <li>An analysis of the business benefits, costs, risks and issues</li>
      <li>A description of the preferred solution</li>
      <li>A summarized plan for implementation</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id1170342391665">The project sponsor then approves the business case, and the required funding is allocated to proceed with a <em data-effect="italics">feasibility </em><em data-effect="italics">study</em>. It is up to the project sponsor to determine if the project is worth undertaking and whether the project will be profitable to the organization. The completion and approval of the feasibility study triggers the beginning of the <em data-effect="italics">planning phase</em>. The feasibility study may also show that the project is not worth pursuing and the project is terminated; thus the next phase never begins.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id1170343724696">All projects are created for a reason. Someone identifies a need and devises a project to address that need. How well the project ultimately addresses that need defines the project’s success or failure.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id1170343812179">The success of your project depends on the clarity and accuracy of your business case and whether people believe they can achieve it. Whenever you consider past experience, your business case is more realistic; and whenever you involve people in the business case’s development, you encourage their commitment to achieving it.</p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id1170347841625">Often the pressure to get results encourages people to go right into identifying possible solutions without fully understanding the need; what the project is trying to accomplish. This strategy can create a lot of immediate activity but it also creates significant chances for waste and mistakes if the wrong need is addressed. One of the best ways to gain approval for a project is to clearly identify the project’s objectives and describe the need or problem for which the project will provide a solution. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id1170343905123">For most of us, being misunderstood is a common occurrence, something that happens on a daily basis. At the restaurant the waiter brings us our dinner and we note that the baked potato is filled with sour cream, even though we expressly requested “no sour cream”. Projects are filled with misunderstandings between customers and project staff. What the customer’s order (or more accurately what they think they order) is often not what they get. This is illustrated in a popular cartoon (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id1170343358770">[link]</a>) called “I know that’s what I said, but it’s not what I meant!” The cartoon demonstrates the importance of establishing clear objectives. </p>

An objective or goal lacks clarity if, when shown to five people, it is interpreted in multiple ways. Ideally, if an objective is clear, you can show it to five people who, after reviewing it, hold a single view about its meaning. The best way to make an objective clear is to state it such a way that it can be verified. Building in measures can do this. It is important to provide quantifiable definitions to qualitative terms. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id1170343656143">For example, an objective of the team principle (project manager) of a Formula 1 racing team may be that their star driver, “finish the lap as fast as possible.” That objective is filled with ambiguity. </p>
    
    
    
    <ul id="id1170343368895"><li>How fast is “fast as possible?” Does that mean the fastest lap time (the time to complete one lap) or does it mean the fastest speed as the car crosses the start/finish line (that is at the finish of the lap)? </li>
      <li>By when should the driver be able to achieve the objective? It is no use having the fastest lap after the race has finished, and equally the fastest lap does not count for qualifying, and therefore grid (starting) position, if it is performed during a practice session. </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id1170342783520">The ambiguity of this objective can be seen from the following example. The <em data-effect="italics">race</em> lap record at the Circuit de Monaco of 1 min 14.439 sec was achieved by Ferrari’s Michael Schumacher in 2004 (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id6781984">[link]</a>). However, he achieved this on lap 23 of the race, but crashed on lap 45 of a 77 lap race! So while he achieved a fastest lap and therefore met the specific project goal of “finish the lap as fast as possible”, it did not result in winning the race, clearly a different project goal. In contrast, the fastest <em data-effect="italics">qualifying</em> time at the same event was by Renault’s Jarno Trulli (1 min 13.985 sec), which gained him pole position for the race, in which he went on to win (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id4699392">[link]</a>). In his case he also achieved the specific project goal of “finish the lap as fast as possible”, but also the larger goal of winning the race! </p>

However, it clarifies the team principal’s intent quite nicely. It should be noted that a clear goal is not enough. It must also be achievable. The team principal’s goal becomes unachievable, for example, if he changes it to require his star driver finish the 3.340 km lap in 30 seconds or less. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_44c29746-62d2-4038-9b6b-4cef5ef2494f_id3728661">To ensure the project’s objectives are achievable and realistic, they must be determined jointly by managers and those who perform the work. Realism is introduced because the people who will do the work have a good sense of what it takes to accomplish a particular task. In addition, this process assures some level of commitment on all sides; management expresses its commitment to support the work effort and worker demonstrate their wiliness to do the work.</p>

   The floor and all furniture will be covered by drop cloths prior to painting each of the 4 office walls, not including the door, base-boards, crown molding, window frames, windows, light switches, or power outlets that will be masked with painters tape. The walls should be painted using Behr paint in Sapphire Berry #550C-2 in the semi-gloss sheen, using a nylon/polyester 3” inch wide brush using a vertical brush stroke, applying two coats of paint, allowing 16 hours between coats, and be completed by Friday, November 7 including removal of all protective tape and drop cloths.

    <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164272614158">Project planning is the heart of the project life cycle, and tells everyone involved where you’re going and how you’re going to get there. The planning phase is where the project plans are documented, the project deliverables and requirements defined, and the project schedule created. It involves creating a set of plans to help guide your team through the execution and closure phases of the project. The plans created during this phase will help you to manage time, cost, quality, change, risk and related issues. It will also help you manage staff and external suppliers, to ensure that you deliver the project on time and within schedule. </p>

You may also need to plan your communications and procurement activities, as well as contract any 3rd party suppliers.</p>

    <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164266759369">The planning phase refines the project’s objectives gathered during the <em data-effect="italics">initiation phase</em> and plans the steps necessary to meet those objectives by further identifying the specific activities and resources required to complete the project. Now that these objectives have been recognized, they must be clearly articulated entailing an in-depth scrutiny of the recognized objective. With such scrutiny, our understanding of the objective will change. Often the very act of trying to describe something precisely gives us a better understanding of what we are looking at. This articulation serves as the basis for the development of requirements. What this means is that after an objective has been clearly articulated (clearly stated) we can go about the business of stipulating in concrete terms what we have to do to achieve it. Obviously, if we do a poor job of articulating the objective, our requirements will be misdirected and the resulting project will not represent the true need. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164242126357">Users will often begin describing their objectives in qualitative language. The project manager must work with the user to provide quantifiable definitions to those qualitative terms. These quantifiable criteria include: schedule, cost, and quality measures. In the case of project objectives, these elements are used as measurements to determine project satisfaction and successful completion. Subjective evaluations can be removed with actual numbers. </p>

  A web user may ask for a <em data-effect="italics">fast system</em>. The quantitative example would be <em data-effect="italics">all screens must load in under 3 seconds</em>.

 Let’s say your company is going to produce a run of holiday eggnog. Your objective statement might be stated this way: <em data-effect="italics">Christmas Cheer, Inc. will produce two million cases of holiday eggnog to be shipped to our distributors by October 30 at a total cost of $1.5 million or less</em>.

You’ve got a collection of team members, and you need to know exactly what they’re going to do to build your product or meet the project’s objectives. The scope planning process if the very first thing you do to manage your scope. Project scope planning is concerned with defining all of the work of the project and only the work needed to successfully meet the project objectives. The whole idea here is that when you start the project, you need to have a clear picture of all the work that needs to happen on your project, and as the project progresses, you need to keep that scope up to date and written down in the project’s <em data-effect="italics">scope management plan</em>.</p>

Deliverables include everything that you and your team produce for the project; anything that your project will deliver. The deliverables for your project include all of the products or services that you and your team are performing for the client, customer, or sponsor. But deliverables include more than that. They also include every single document, plan, schedule, budget, blueprint, and anything else that gets made along the way; including all of the project management documents you put together. Project deliverables are measurable outcomes, measurable results, or specific items that must be produced to consider the project or project phase completed. Deliverables like objectives must be specific and verifiable. </p>

          <li>A twin engine plane versus a single engine plane. </li>
          <li>A red marker versus a green marker. </li>
          <li>A daily report versus a weekly report. </li>

They are restrictions or constraints to be placed on the deliverable and how to build it. Their purpose is to restrict the number of solutions that will meet a set of requirements.

They answer how the system needs to be designed and implemented to provide required functionality and fulfill required operational characteristics. For example, in a software project, the functional requirements may stipulate that a data base system will be developed to allow access to financial data through a remote terminal; the corresponding technical requirements would spell out the architecture of the data structure, the language in which the database management system will be written, the hardware on which the system will run, telecommunication protocols that should be used and so forth. </p>

Understanding the reasoning that used to arrive at a decision is critical in avoiding repetition. For example, if a particular feature has been excluded because it is simply not feasible, that fact needs to be recorded. If it is not, then the project risks wasted work and repetition when a stakeholder requests the feature be reinstated during development or testing. Once the requirements are documented, have the stakeholders sign off on their requirements as a confirmation of what they desire.</p><p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164257979245">While the project manager is responsible for making certain the requirements are documented, it does not mean the project manager must perform this task. The project manager can enlist the help of stakeholders, business analysts, requirement analysts, business process owners, and other team members to conduct the interviews and document the requirements. The project manager then reviews the requirements and incorporates them into the project documentation and project plan. </p>

The work breakdown structure (WBS) defines the scope of the project and breaks the work down into components that can be scheduled and estimated and easily monitored and controlled. The idea behind the work breakdown schedule is simple. You subdivide a complicated task into smaller tasks, until you reach a level that cannot be further subdivided. Anyone familiar with the arrangements of folders and files in a computer memory, or who has researched their ancestral family free, should be familiar with this idea. You stop breaking down the work when you reach a low enough level to perform an estimate of the desired accuracy. At that point, it is usually easier to estimate how long the small task will take and how much it will cost to perform than it would have been to estimate these factors at the higher levels. Each descending level of the WBS represents an increased level of detailed definition of the project work.</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164264122665">As an example, if I want to clean a room, I might begin by picking up clothes, toys, and other things that have been dropped on the floor. I could use a vacuum cleaner to get dirt out of the carpet. I might take down the curtains and take them to the cleaners, then dust the furniture. All of these tasks are subtasks performed to clean the room. As for vacuuming the room, I might have to get the vacuum cleaner out of the closet, connect the hose, empty the bag, and put the machine back in the closet. These are smaller tasks to be performed in accomplishing the subtask called vacuuming.

For example, under <em data-effect="italics">3.0 Vacuum</em> (in <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164231276487">[link]</a>), it would be obvious that <em data-effect="italics">3.3 Vacuum carpet</em> would be performed after <em data-effect="italics">3.4 Connect hose and plug</em>! However, you will probably find yourself thinking sequentially, as it seems to be human nature to do so. The main idea of creating a WBS is to capture all of the tasks, irrespective of their order. So if you find yourself and other members of your team thinking sequentially, don’t be too concerned, but don’t get hung up on trying to diagram the sequence or you will slow down the process of task identification. </p>

This unique identifier is typically a number, and it’s used to sum and track costs, schedules, and resources associated with WBS elements. These numbers are usually associated with the corporation’s chart of accounts, which is used to track costs by category. Collectively, these numeric identifiers are known as the code of accounts.</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164273596824">There are also many ways you can organize the WBS. For example, it can be organized by either deliverable or phase. The major deliverables of the project are used as the first level in the WBS. For example, if you are doing a multimedia project the deliverables might include producing a book, CD and a DVD (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164227969616">[link]</a>).</p>

You need to include enough levels to accurately estimate project time and costs but not so many levels that are difficult to distinguish between components. Regardless of the number of levels in a WBS, the lowest level in a WBS is called a work package.</p>

The work package level is where time estimates, costs estimates and resource estimates are determined.<em data-effect="italics"/></p>

In order to develop our schedule, we first need to define the activities, sequence them in the right order, estimate resources and estimate the time it will take to complete the tasks.</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164259117726">The activity definition process is a further breakdown of the work package elements of the WBS. It documents the specific activities needed to fulfill the deliverable detailed in the WBS. These are not deliverables but the individual units of work that must be completed to fulfill the deliverables. Activity definition uses everything we already know about the project to divide the work into activities that can be estimated. You might want to look at all the lessons learned from similar projects your company has done to get a god idea of what you need to do on the current one. </p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164225302702">Expert judgment in the form of project team members with prior experience developing project scope statements and WBS can help you define activities. You might also use experts in a particular field to help define tasks if you were asked to manage a project in a new domain; to help you understand what activities were going to be involved. It could be that you create an activity list and then have the expert review it and suggest changes. Alternatively, you could involve the expert from the very beginning and ask to have an activity definition conversation with him before even making your first draft of the list. </p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164273569086">Sometimes you start a project without knowing a lot about the work that you’ll be doing later. Rolling wave planning lets you plan and schedule only the stuff that you know enough about to plan well. When you don’t know enough about a project to come up with a complete activity list, you can use a planning component as a placeholder until you know more. These are extra items put at high levels in the WBS to allow you to plan for the unknown.<em data-effect="italics"/></p>

The three main kinds of predecessors are <em data-effect="italics">finish-to-start</em> (FS), <em data-effect="italics">start-to-start</em> (SS) and <em data-effect="italics">finish-to-finish</em> (FF).</p>

This happens when activities require that a task be started before it can finish. An example might be that singing couldn’t start until after the music had started. Keep in mind that tasks like that are pretty rare and almost never show up in network diagrams. In addition there are some particular types of predecessors that must be considered. </p>

Although <em data-effect="italics">activity-on-node</em> (AON) is more commonly used and is supported by all project management programs, PERT is the best-known AOA-type diagram and is the historical basis of all network diagramming. The main difference is the AOA diagram is traditionally drawn using circles as the nodes, with nodes representing the beginning and ending points of the arrows or tasks. In the AOA network, the arrows represent the activities or tasks (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164250152330">[link]</a>).</p>

        <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164242565743">The three major disadvantages of the AOA method are:</p>
        <ul id="id1164265744936">
          <li>The AOA network can only show finish to start relationships. It is not possible to show lead and lag except by adding or subtracting time, which makes project tracking difficult. </li>
          <li>There are instances when dummy activities can occur in an AOA network. Dummy activities are activities that show the dependency of one task on other tasks but for other than technical reasons. For example, a task may be dependent on another because it would be more cost effective to use the same resources for the two; otherwise the two tasks could be accomplished in parallel. Dummy activities do not have durations associated with them. They simply show that a task has some kind of dependence on another task. </li>
          <li>AOA diagrams are not as widely used as AON simply because the latter are somewhat simpler to use and all project management software programs can accommodate AON networks, whereas not all can accommodate AOA networks. </li>

Every activity in your activity list needs to have resources assigned to it. Before you can assign resources to your project, you need to know which ones you’re authorized to use; that’s called resource availability. Resource availability includes information about what resources you can use on your project and when they’re available to you. Don’t forget that some resources like consultants or training rooms have to be scheduled in advance, and they might only be available at certain times. You’ll need to know this before you can finish planning your project. If you are starting to plan in January, a June wedding is harder to plan than one in December, because the wedding halls are all booked up in advance. That is clearly a resource constraint. You’ll also need the activity list that you created earlier, and you’ll need to know about how your organization typically handles resources. Once you’ve got a handle on these things, you’re set for resource estimation. </p>

        <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164271570552">The goal of activity resource estimating is to assign resources to each activity in the activity list. There are five tools and techniques for the activity resource estimating process. Some of them have technical sounding names, but they’re all actually pretty sensible when you think about it. They should make sense to you when you think about what you have to do when you have to figure out what resources your project needs.</p>
        <ul id="id1164256920557"><li><strong data-effect="bold">Expert judgment</strong> means bringing in experts who have done this sort of work before and getting their opinions on what resources are needed (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164265918221">[link]</a>).</li>
	<li><strong data-effect="bold">Alternative analysis</strong> means considering several different options for how you assign resources. This includes varying the number of resources as well as the kind of resources you use. Many times, there’s more than one way to accomplish an activity and alternative analysis helps decide among the possibilities.</li>
	<li><strong data-effect="bold">Published estimating data</strong> is something that project managers in a lot of industries use to help them figure out how many resources they need. They rely on articles, books, journals, and periodicals that collect, analyze, and publish data from other people’s projects.</li>
	<li><strong data-effect="bold">Project management software </strong>such as Microsoft project will often have features designed to help project managers estimate resource needs and constraints and find the best combination of assignments for the project.</li>
	<li><strong data-effect="bold">Bottom-up estimating</strong> means breaking down complex activities into pieces and working out the resource assignments for each piece. It is a process of estimating these individual activities or costs and then adding these up together to come up with a total estimate. Here you estimate every scheduled activity individually and then roll up that estimate; or add them all together, to come up with a total. Bottom-up estimating is a very accurate means of estimating, provided the estimates at the schedule activity level are accurate. However, it takes a considerable amount of time to perform bottom-up estimating because every activity must be accessed and estimated accurately to be included in the bottom-up calculation. The smaller and more detailed the activity, the greater the accuracy and cost of this technique.</li>

The <em data-effect="italics">activity duration estimates</em> are an estimate of how long each activity in the activity list will take. This is a quantitative measure usually expressed in hours, weeks, days, or months. Any work period is fine, and you’ll use different work periods for different jobs. A small job (like booking a DJ) may just take a few hours; a bigger job (like catering-including deciding on a menu, ordering ingredients, cook food and serving guests on the big day) could take days. </p>

Duration is the amount of the time that an activity takes, while effort if the total number of person-hours that are expended. If it takes two people six hours to carve the ice sculpture for the centerpiece of a wedding, the duration is six hours. But if two people worked on it for the whole time, it took twelve person-hours of effort to create! </p>

You have to really think through all of the aspects of a task in order to estimate it.

She still has some work to do before she’s got the whole project under control. Steve and Susan know where they want to get married, and they’ve got the place booked now, but what about the caterer? They have no idea who’s going to be providing food. And what about the band they want? Will the timing with their schedule work out? </p>

And the same goes for your <em data-effect="italics">activity list</em> and <em data-effect="italics">duration estimates</em> too!

This assures they have read the schedule, understand the dates and resource commitments, and will likely cooperate. You’ll also need to obtain confirmation that will be available as outlined in the schedule. The schedule cannot be finalized until you receive approval and commitment for the resource assignments outlined in it. </p>

Project progress and task completion will be monitored and tracked against the project schedule to determine if the project is on course as planned. </p>
        <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164260296852">The schedule can be displayed in a variety of ways, some of which are variations of what you have already seen. Project schedule network diagrams will work as schedule diagrams when you add the start and finish dates to each activity. These diagrams usually show the activity dependencies and critical path. </p>
        <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164277165066">The critical path method is an important tool for keeping your projects on track. Every network diagram has something that is called the critical path. It’s the string of activities that, if you add up all of the durations, is longer than any other path through the network. It usually starts with the first activity in the network and usually ends with the last one. </p>

If you know an activity is not on the critical path, then you know a delay in that activity may not necessarily delay the project. This can really help you handle emergency situations. Even better, it means that if you need to bring your project in earlier than was originally planned, you know that by adding resources to the critical path will be much more effective than adding them elsewhere.</p>

If you had a bigger budget, you could probably get more people to do your project more quickly and deliver more. That’s why no project plan is complete until you come up with a budget (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164227629697">[link]</a>).

Once this is obtained, add up the cost estimates into a budget plan. It is now possible to track the project according to that budget while the work is ongoing. </p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164267776003">A lot of times you come into a project and there is already an expectation of how much it will cost or how much time it will take. When you make an estimate really early in the project and you don’t know much about it, that estimate is called a <em data-effect="italics">rough order of magnitude</em> estimate (or a ballpark estimate). It’s expected that this estimate will become more refined as time goes on and you learn more about the project. Here are some more tools and techniques used to estimate cost:</p>
      <ul id="id1164254592731">
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Determine resource cost rates:</strong> People who will be working on the project all work at a specific rate. Any materials you will use to build the project (like wood or wiring) will be charged at a rate too. This just means figuring out what the rate for labor and materials will be. </li>
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Vendor bid analysis:</strong> Sometimes you will need to work with an external contractor to get your project done. You might even have more than one contractor bid on the job. This tool is all about evaluating those bids and choosing the one you will go with.</li>
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Reserve analysis:</strong> You need to set aside some money for cost overruns. If you know that your project has a risk of something expensive happening, better to have some cash lying around to deal with it. Reserve analysis means putting some cash away just in case.</li>
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Cost of quality:</strong> You will need to figure the cost of all your quality related activities into the overall budget, too. Since it’s cheaper to find bugs earlier in the project than later, there are always quality costs associated with everything your project produces. Cost of quality is just a way of tracking the cost of those activities and is how much money it takes to do the project right.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164242299314">Once you apply all the tools in this process, you will arrive at an estimate for how much your project will cost. It’s always important to keep all of your supporting estimate information, too. That way, you know the assumptions you made when you were coming up with your numbers. Now you are ready to build your budget plan. </p>

Next, you send out your contract requirements to sellers. They bid for the chance to work with you. You pick the best one, and then you sign the contract with them. Once the work begins, you monitor it to make sure the contract is being followed. When the work is done, you close out the contract and fill out all the paperwork. </p>

You need to think about all of the work that you will contract out for your project before you do anything else. You will want to plan for any purchases and acquisitions. Here’s where you take a close look at your needs, to be sure that you really need to create a contract. You figure out what kinds of contracts make sense for your project, and you try to define all of the parts of your project that will be contracted out. </p>

It could also mean deciding whether to build a solution to your problem or buy one that is already available. Most of the same factors that help you make every other major project decision will help you with this one. How much does it cost to build it as opposed to buy it? How will this decision affect the scope of your project? How about project schedule? Do you have time to do the work and still meet your commitments? As you plan out what you will and won’t contract, you need to have thought through your reasoning pretty carefully. </p>

No matter how well you plan, your project can always run into unexpected problems. Team members get sick or quit, resources that you were depending on turn out to be unavailable, even the weather can throw you for a loop. For example, Hurricane Ike. So does that mean that you’re helpless against unknown problems? No! You can use risk planning to identify potential problems that could cause trouble for your project, analyze how likely they’ll be to occur, take action to prevent the risks you can avoid, and minimize the ones that you can’t.</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164225697286">A risk is any uncertain event or condition that might affect your project. Not all risks are negative. Some events (like finding an easier way to do an activity) or conditions (like lower prices for certain materials) can help your project. When this happens, we call it an opportunity; but it’s still handled just like a risk. </p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164267906702">There are no guarantees on any project. Even the simplest activity can turn into unexpected problems. Any time there’s anything that might occur on your project and change the outcome of a project activity, we call that a risk. A risk can be an event (like a hurricane) or it can be a condition (like an important part being unavailable). Either way, it’s something that may or may not happen ...but if it does, then it will force you to change the way you and your team will work on the project. </p>

But eventually, some of the risks that you plan do happen. And that’s when you have to deal with them. There are four basic ways to handle a risk.</p>
      <ol id="id1164279466808" type="1"><li><strong data-effect="bold">Avoid:</strong> The best thing that you can do with a risk is to avoid it. If you can prevent it from happening, it definitely won’t hurt your project. The easiest way to avoid this risk is to walk away from the cliff (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164225805638">[link]</a>), but that may not be an option on this project. </li>
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Mitigate:</strong> If you can’t avoid the risk, you can mitigate it. This means taking some sort of action that will cause it to do as little damage to your project as possible (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164225805638">[link]</a>). </li>
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Transfer:</strong> One effective way to deal with a risk is to pay someone else to accept it for you (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164225805638">[link]</a>). The most common way to do this is to buy insurance. </li>
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Accept:</strong> When you can’t avoid, mitigate, or transfer a risk, then you have to accept it (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164225805638">[link]</a>). But even when you accept a risk, at least you’ve looked at the alternatives and you know what will happen of it occurs. If you can’t avoid the risk, and there’s nothing you can do to reduce its impact, then accepting it is your only choice. </li>
      </ol>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164261415351">By the time a risk actually occurs on your project, it’s too late to do anything about it. That’s why you need to plan for risks from the beginning and keep coming back to do more planning throughout the project.</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164267981252">The <em data-effect="italics">risk management</em> plan tells you how you’re going to handle risk in your project. It documents how you’ll access risk on the project, who is responsible for doing it, and how often you’ll do risk planning (since you’ll have to meet about risk planning with your team throughout the project.)</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164240165634">The plan has parts that are really useful for managing risks. </p>
      <ul id="id1164224995738">
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Risk categories</strong> that you’ll use to classify your risks. Some risks are technical, like a component that might turn out to be difficult to use. Others are external, like changes in the market or even problems with the weather.</li>
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Risk breakdown structure (RBS)</strong> is a great tool for managing your risk categories. It looks like a WBS, except instead of tasks it shows how the risks break down into categories.</li>
      </ul>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164262662776">It’s important to come up with guidelines to help you figure out how big a risk’s impact is. The impact tells you how much damage the risk will cause to your project. A lot of projects classify impact on a scale from minimal to severe, or from very low to very high. The plan should also give you a scale to help figure out the probability of the risk. Some risks are very likely; others aren’t. </p>

You need to be sure you make the right product to suit your stakeholders’ needs. Quality means making sure that you build what you said you would and that you do it as efficiently as you can. That means trying not to make too many mistakes and always keeping your project working toward the goal of creating the right product!</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164273715985">Everybody “knows” what quality is. But the way the word is used in everyday life is a little different that how it is used in project management. Just like the tripe constraint, scope, cost, and schedule- you manage quality on your project by setting goals and taking measurements. That’s why you need to understand the quality levels your stakeholders believe are acceptable, and that your projects meet those targets; just like it needs to meet their budget and schedule goals.</p>
      <ul id="id1164265831494">
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Customer satisfaction</strong> is about making sure that the people who are paying for the end product are happy with what they get. When the team gathers requirements for the specification, they try to write down all of the things that the customers want in the product so that you know how to make them happy. Some requirements can be left unstated, too. Those are the ones that are implied by the customer’s explicit needs. For example: some requirements are just common sense, like a product that people hold can’t be made from toxic chemicals that kill you. It might not be stated, but it’s definitely a requirement! </li>
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Fitness to use</strong> is about making sure that the product you build has the best design possible to fit the customer’s needs. Which would you choose: a product that’s beautifully designed, well constructed, solidly built and all around pleasant to look at but does not do what you need, or a product that does what you want despite being really ugly and hard to use? You’ll always choose the product that fits your needs, even if it’s seriously limited. That’s why it’s important that the product both does what it is supposed to do and does it well. For example: you could pound in a nail with a screwdriver, but a hammer is better fit for the job. </li>
        <li><strong data-effect="bold">Conformance to requirements</strong> is the core of both customer satisfaction and fitness to use, and is a measure of how well your product does what you intend. Above all, your product needs to do what you wrote down in your requirements document. Your requirements should take into account what will satisfy your customer and the best design possible for the job. That means conforming to both stated and implied requirements.</li>
      </ul>

      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164234428273">Quality planning focuses on taking all of the information available to you at the beginning of your project and figuring out how you will measure your quality and prevent defects. Your company should have a quality policy that tells how it measures quality across the organization. You should make sure your project follows the company policy and any governmental rules or regulations on how you need to plan quality for your project.</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164280410662">You need to plan out which activities you’re going to use to measure the quality of the product of your project. And you need to be sure the activities you plan are going to pay off in the end. So you’ll need to think about the cost of all the quality-related activities you want to do. Then you’ll need to set some guidelines for what you going to measure against. Finally, you’ll need to design the tests you’re going to run when the product is ready to be tested. </p>

        <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164267889943">The following represents the quality planning tools available to the project manager. </p>
        <ul id="id1164225622389">
          <li><strong data-effect="bold">Cost benefit analysis</strong> is looking at how much your quality activities will cost versus how much you will gain from doing them. The costs are easy to measure; the effort and resources it takes to do them are just like any other task on your schedule. Since quality activities don’t actually produce a product, it is harder for people to measure the benefit sometimes. The main benefits are less re-work, higher productivity and efficiency and more satisfaction from both the team and the customer.</li>
          <li><strong data-effect="bold">Benchmarking</strong> means using the results of quality planning on other projects to set goals for your own. You might find that the last project in your company had 20% fewer defects than the one before it. You should want to learn from a project like that and put in practice any of the ideas they used to make such a great improvement. Benchmarks can give you some reference points for judging your own project before you even get started with the work.</li>
          <li><strong data-effect="bold">Design of experiments</strong> is the list of all the kinds of tests you are going to run on your product. It might list all the kinds of test procedures you’ll do, the approaches you’ll take, and even the tests themselves. (In the software world, this is called test planning).</li>
          <li><strong data-effect="bold">Cost of quality</strong> is what you get when you add up the cost of all the prevention and inspection activities you are going to do on your project. It doesn’t just include the testing. It includes any time spent writing standards, reviewing documents, meeting to analyze the root causes of defects, re-work to fix the defects once they’re found by the team; absolutely everything you do to ensure quality on the project. </li>
        </ul>
        <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164224223562">Cost of quality can be a good number to check whether your project is doing well or having trouble. Say your company tracks cost of quality on all of its projects. Then you could tell if you were spending more or less than they are to get your project up to quality standards.</p>
        <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164238117555">Once you have your quality plan, you know your guidelines for managing quality on your project. Your strategies for monitoring your project quality should be included in the plan, as well as the reasons for all the steps you are taking. It’s important that everyone on the team understand the rationale behind the metrics being used to judge success or failure of the project.</p>

      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164224948162">Communications management is about keeping everybody in the loop. Have you ever tried talking to someone in a really loud, crowded room? That’s what running a project is like if you don’t get a handle on communications. The communications planning process concerns defining the types of information you’re going to deliver, to whom, the format for communicating the information and when. It turns out that 90% of a project manager’s job is spent on communication so it’s important to make sure everybody gets the right message at the right time.</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164271243747">The first step in defining your communication plan is figuring out what kind of communication your stakeholders need from the project so that they can make good decisions. This is called the <em data-effect="italics">communications requirements analysis</em>. Your project will produce a lot of information; you don’t want to overwhelm your stakeholders with all of it. Your job here is to figure out what they feel is valuable. Communicating valuable information doesn’t mean you always paint a rosy picture. Communications to stakeholders may consist of either good news or bad news- the point is that you don’t want to bury stakeholders in too much information but give them enough so that they’re informed and can make appropriate decisions.</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164236479460"><em data-effect="italics">Communications technology</em> has a major impact on how you can keep people in the loop. This examines the methods (or technology) used to communicate the information to, from and among the stakeholders. Methods of communicating can take many forms, such as written, spoken, e-mail, formal status reports, meetings, online databases, online schedules, project websites and so forth. You should consider several factors before deciding what methods you’ll choose to transfer information. The timing of the information exchange or need for updates is the first factor. It’s a lot easier for people to get information on their projects if it’s accessible through a web site, than if all your information is passed around by paper memos. Do you need to procure new technology or systems, or are there systems already in place that will work? The technologies available to you will definitely figure into your plan of how you will keep everyone notified of project status and issues. Staff experience with the technology is another factor. Are there project team members and stakeholders experienced at using this technology, or will you need to train them? Finally, consider the duration of the project and the project environment. Will the technology you’re choosing work throughout the life of the project or will it have to be upgraded or updated at some point? And how does the project team function? Are they located together or spread out across several campuses or locations? The answers to these questions should be documented in the communication plan.</p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164225154491">All projects require sound communication plans, but not all projects will have the same types of communication or the same methods for distributing the information. The communication plan documents the types of information needs the stakeholders have, when the information should be distributed and how the information will be delivered.</p><p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164234404454">The type of information you will typically communicate includes project status, project scope statements, and scope statement updates, project baseline information, risks, action items, performance measures, project acceptance and so on. What’s important to know now is that the information needs of the stakeholders should be determined as early in the planning phase of the project management lifecycle as possible so that as you and your team develop project planning documents, you already know who should receive copies of them and how they should be delivered.</p>

      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164282610705">Believe it or not, we have officially completed the <em data-effect="italics">planning phase</em> of the project management lifecycle. The project plan is the approved, formal, documented plan that’s used to guide you throughout the project <em data-effect="italics">execution phase</em>. The plan is made up of all the processes of the planning phase. It is the map that tells you where you’re going and how to perform the activities of the project plan during the project execution phase. It serves several purposes; the most important of which is tracking and measuring project performance. The project plan is critical in all communications you’ll have from here forward with the stakeholders, management, and customers. The project plan encompasses everything we talked about up to now and is represented in a formal document or collection of documents. This document contains the project scope, deliverables, assumptions, risks, WBS, milestones, project schedule, resources, communication plan, the project budget and any procurement needs. It becomes the baseline you’ll use to measure and track progress against. It is also used to help you control the components that tend to stray away from the original plan so you can get them back on track. </p>
      <p id="auto_7037d48a-405a-476e-b48d-e0b5b0262641_id1164224894787">The project plan is used as a communication and information tool for stakeholders, team members and the management team. They will use the project plan to review and gauge progress as well. Your last step in the planning phase is obtaining sign-off of the project plan from stakeholders, the sponsor and the management team. If they’ve been an integral part of the planning processes all along (and I know you know how important this is), obtaining sign-off of the project plan should simply be a formality.</p>

    <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2310939">After you have carefully planned your project, you will be ready to start the project execution phase, the third phase of the project management <em data-effect="italics">life cycle</em>. The execution phase involves putting the project plan into action. It’s here that the project manager will coordinate and direct project resources to meet the objectives of the project plan. As the project unfolds, it’s the project manager’s job to direct and manage each activity on the project, every step of the way. That’s what happens in the <em data-effect="italics">execution phase</em> of the project lifecycle; you simply follow the plan you’ve put together and handle any problems that come up. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2310964">The execution phase is where you and your project team actually do the project work to produce the deliverables. The word deliverable means anything your project delivers. The deliverables for your project include all of the products or services that you and your team are performing for the client, customer or sponsor including all the project management documents that you put together. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2310971">The steps undertaken to build each deliverable will vary depending on the type of project you are undertaking, and cannot therefore be described here in any real detail. For instance engineering and telecommunications projects will focus on using equipment, resources and materials to construct each project deliverable, whereas computer software projects may require the development and implementation of software code routines to produce each project deliverable. The activities required to build each deliverable will be clearly specified within the project requirements document and project plan accordingly. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2310980">Your job as project manager is to direct the work, but you need to do more than deliver the results. You also need to keep track of how well your team performed. The executing phase keeps the project plan on track with careful monitoring and control processes to ensure the final deliverable meets the acceptance criteria set by the customer. This phase is typically where approved changes are implemented. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2310988">Most often changes are identified through looking at performance and quality control data. Routine performance and quality control measurements should be evaluated on a regular basis throughout the execution phase. Gathering reports on those measurements will help you determine where the problem is and recommend changes to fix it. </p>
    
    
    
    <section data-depth="1" id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2310995"><h3 data-type="title">Change control</h3>
      <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2311002">When you find a problem, you can’t just make a change, because what if it’s too expensive, or will it take too long? You will need to look at how it affects the triple constraint (<em data-effect="italics">time</em>, <em data-effect="italics">cost</em>, <em data-effect="italics">scope</em>) and how they impact quality. You will then have to figure out if it is worth making the change. Change control is a set of procedures that let you make changes in an organized way. </p>
      <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2311029">Anytime you need to make a change to your plan, you need to start with a <em data-effect="italics">change request</em> (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#id2311044 ">[link]</a>). This is a document that either you or the person making the request needs to create. Any change to your project needs to be documented so you can figure out what needs to be done, by when, and by whom.</p>
      <figure id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2311044"><figcaption>Is it too late to add the client’s wish list of features to the project? </figcaption><span data-alt="" data-type="media" id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2311044_media">

      <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2311072">Once the change request is documented, it is submitted to a <em data-effect="italics">change control board</em>. A change control board is a group of people who consider changes for approval. Not every change control system has a board but most do. The change request could also be submitted to the project sponsor or management for review and approval. Putting the recommended changes through change control will help you evaluate the impact and update all the necessary documents. Not all changes are approved, but if the changes and repairs are approved, you send them back to the team to put them in place. </p>
      <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2311086">The execution phase will utilize the most project time and resources and as a result, costs are usually the highest during the executing phase. Project managers will also experience the greatest conflicts over schedules in this phase. You may find as your monitoring your project, the actual time it is taking to do the scheduled work is taking longer than the amount of time you planned. If you evaluate the impact of the change and find that it won’t have an impact on the project triple constraint, then you can make the change without going through change control. </p>
      <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2311100">When you absolutely have to meet the date and you are running behind, you can sometimes find ways to do activities more quickly by adding more resources to critical path tasks. That’s called<strong data-effect="bold"/><em data-effect="italics">crashing</em>. Crashing the schedule means adding resources or moving them around to shorten it. Crashing ALWAYS costs more and doesn’t always work! There’s no way to crash a schedule without raising the overall cost of the project. So, if the budget is fixed and you don’t have any extra money to spend, you can’t use this technique.</p>
      <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2311125">Sometimes you’ve got two activities planned to occur in sequence, but you can actually do them at the same time. This is called <em data-effect="italics">fast-tracking</em> the project. On a software project, you might do both your <em data-effect="italics">user acceptance testing</em> (UAT) and your functional testing at the same time, for example. This is pretty risky. There’s a good chance you might need to redo some of the work you have done concurrently. Crashing and fast tracking are schedule compression tools. Managing schedule change means keeping all of your schedule documents up to date. That way, you will always be comparing your results to the right plan. </p>
      <p id="auto_f81c8ae6-22ba-4de7-b0bd-6b254fd18111_id2311149">After the deliverables have been physically constructed and accepted by the customer a phase review is carried out to determine whether the project is complete and ready for closure. </p>

    <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721224074">Every project needs to end and that’s what project closeout is all about in the last phase of the <em data-effect="italics">project lifecycle</em>. The whole point of the project is that you need to deliver what you promised. By making sure you delivered everything you said you would, you make sure that all stakeholders are satisfied and all acceptance criteria has been met. Once that happens, your project can finish (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#id1170721224522 ">[link]</a>). </p>

Once the project is over, it’s easy to pack things up, throw some files in a drawer, and start moving right into the initiation phase of the next project. Hold on! You’re not done yet! </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721225156">The key activity in project closeout is gathering project records and disseminating information to formalize acceptance of the product, service or project as well as to perform project closure. As the project manager, you will want to review project documents to make certain they are up-to-date. For example, perhaps some scope change requests were implemented that changed some of the characteristics of the final product. The project information you are collecting during this phase should reflect the characteristics and specifications of the final product. Don’t forget to update your resource assignments as well. Some team members will have come and gone over the course of the project; you need to double-check that all the resources and their roles and responsibilities are noted. </p>
    
    
    
    <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721225236">Once the project outcomes are documented, you’ll request formal acceptance from the stakeholders or customer. They’re interested in knowing if the product or service of the project meets the objectives the project set out to accomplish. If your documentation is up-to-date, you’ll have the project results at hand to share with them.</p>

      <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721225439">Project closeout is also concerned with analyzing the project management processes to determine their effectiveness and to document <em data-effect="italics">lessons learned</em>. Lessons learned are used to document the successes and failures of the project. As an example, lessons learned document the reasons why specific corrective actions were taken, their outcomes, the causes of performance variances, unplanned risks that occurred, mistakes that were made and could have been avoided and so on. </p>
      <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721225532">Unfortunately, sometimes projects do fail. There are things that can be learned from the failure of a project (as well from successful projects), and this information should be documented for future reference. Lessons learned can be some of the most valuable information you’ll take away from any project. We can all learn from our experiences, and what better way to have more success on your next project than to review a similar past project’s lessons learned document? But it is important not to forget the lessons learned! </p>

      <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721225820">Contracts come to a close just as projects come to a close. <em data-effect="italics">Contract closure</em> is concerned with completing and settling the terms of the contract. It supports the project closeout process because the contract closure process determines if the work described in the contract was completed accurately and satisfactorily. Keep in mind that not all projects are performed under contract so not all projects require the contract closure process. Obviously, this process applies only to those phases, deliverables or portions of the project that were performed under contract.</p>
      <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721226032">Contract closure updates the project records detailing the final results of the work on the project. Contracts may have specific terms or conditions for completion and closeout. You should be aware of these terms or conditions so that project closeout isn’t held up because you missed an important detail. If you are administering the contract yourself, be sure to ask your procurement department if there are any special conditions that you should be aware of so that your project team doesn’t inadvertently delay contract project closure.</p>
      <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721226147">One of the purposes of contract closure process is to provide formal notice to the seller- usually in written form, that the deliverables are acceptable and satisfactory or have been rejected. If the product or service does not meet the expectations, the vendor will need to correct the problems before you issue a formal acceptance notice. Hopefully, quality audits have been performed during the course of the project and the vendor was given the opportunity to make corrections earlier in the process than the closing phase. It’s not a good idea to wait until the very end of the project and then spring all the problems and issues on the vendor at once. It’s much more efficient to discuss problems with your vendor as the project progresses because it provides the opportunity for correction when the problems occur.</p>
      <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721226196">If the product or service does meet the project’s expectation and is acceptable, formal written notice to the seller is required indicating that the contract is complete. This is the formal acceptance and closure of the contract. It’s your responsibility as the project manager to document the formal acceptance of the contract. Many times the provisions for formalizing acceptance and closing the contract are spelled out in the contract itself. </p>
      <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721226315">If you have a procurement department handling the contract administration, they will expect you to inform them when the contract is complete and will in turn follow the formal procedures to let the seller know the contract is complete. However, you’ll still note the contract completion in your copy of the project records.</p>

      <p id="auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721226529">Releasing project team members is not an official process. However, it should be noted that at the conclusion of the project, you will release your project team members, and they will go back to their functional managers or get assigned to a new project. You will want to keep their managers, or other project managers, informed as you get closer to project completion, so that they have time to adequately plan for the return of their employees. Start letting them know a few months ahead of time what the schedule looks like and how soon they can plan on using their employees on new projects. This gives the other managers the ability to start planning activities and scheduling activity dates.</p>

A celebration helps team members formally recognize the project end and brings closure to the work they’ve done. It also encourages them to remember what they’ve learned and to start thinking about how their experiences will benefit them and the organization during the next project (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_36cf940f-a8ca-43ff-bd99-d3d6bc722d86_id1170721226944">[link]</a>).</p>

    <p id="auto_88b9c418-23f9-4469-97d5-479268346827_id8663911">Every discipline has its own vocabulary, and project management is no exception. Part of the process of successfully deploying project management in your organization is to standardize the terminology. That way, when one person talks about risks, scope, issues, requirements, and other project management concerns, everyone else knows what he or she is referring to. This glossary contains common terms used in project management and can help start the standardization process.</p>

      <p id="auto_88b9c418-23f9-4469-97d5-479268346827_id1165167765127">There may be external circumstances or events that must occur for the project to be successful (or that should happen to increase your chances of success). If you believe that the probability of the event occurring is acceptable, you could list it as an assumption. An assumption has a probability between 0 and 100%. That is, it is not impossible that the event will occur (0%) and it is not a fact (100%). It is somewhere in between. Assumptions are important because they set the context in which the entire remainder of the project is defined. If an assumption doesn't come through, the estimate and the rest of the project definition may no longer be valid. </p>
