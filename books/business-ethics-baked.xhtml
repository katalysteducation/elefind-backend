<p id="auto_eb1e3bc3-d0fd-4119-b0ed-f7a206e545b2_fs-idm184076816">Our <em data-effect="italics">Business Ethics</em> textbook adheres to the scope and sequence requirements of introductory business ethics courses nationwide. We have endeavored to make the core theories and practical concepts of business ethics engaging, relevant, and accessible to students. The guiding themes of the textbook are to promote high ethical standards and to assist the integration of ethical thinking across the business school curriculum, with an end result of encouraging even greater ethical consciousness on the part of business practitioners beyond their graduation. We particularly emphasize the reality of today&#8217;s global business community and observe that geography, culture, and time contribute to ethical concepts and constructs. With awareness of these issues in mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to emphasize the necessity&#8212;and difficulty&#8212;of ethical decision-making. The authors seek to help students recognize legal and moral issues, reason through the consequences of different courses of action, and promote social responsibility. The text emphasizes connections between topics such as ethical theories, legal responsibilities, the prioritization of stakeholders, and corporate social responsibility. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from business ethics instructors dedicated to the project.</p>

<p id="auto_282cabf7-18a2-4e8c-b46d-3cdd8e6bc5c8_fs-idm401816592">Ethics consists of the standards of behavior to which we hold ourselves in our personal and professional lives. It establishes the levels of honesty, empathy, and trustworthiness and other virtues by which we hope to identify our personal behavior and our public reputation. In our personal lives, our ethics sets norms for the ways in which we interact with family and friends. In our professional lives, ethics guides our interactions with customers, clients, colleagues, employees, and shareholders affected by our business practices (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_282cabf7-18a2-4e8c-b46d-3cdd8e6bc5c8_OSX_Ethics_01_00_Decisions">Figure 1.1</a>).</p>



<p id="auto_282cabf7-18a2-4e8c-b46d-3cdd8e6bc5c8_fs-idm407212944">Should we care about ethics in our lives? In our practices in business and the professions? That is the central question we will examine in this chapter and throughout the book. Our goal is to understand why the answer is <em data-effect="italics">yes</em>.</p>



<p id="auto_282cabf7-18a2-4e8c-b46d-3cdd8e6bc5c8_fs-idm404973376">Whatever hopes you have for your future, you almost certainly want to be successful in whatever career you choose. But what does success mean to you, and how will you know you have achieved it? Will you measure it in terms of wealth, status, power, or recognition? Before blindly embarking on a quest to achieve these goals, which society considers important, stop and think about what a successful career means to you personally. Does it include a blameless reputation, colleagues whose good opinion you value, and the ability to think well of yourself? How might ethics guide your decision-making and contribute to your achievement of these goals?</p>

You may decide you should always tell the truth to family, friends, customers, clients, and shareholders, and if that is not possible, you should have very good reasons why you cannot. You may also choose never to defraud or mislead your business partners. You may decide, as well, that while you are pursuing profit in your business, you will not require that all the money on the table come your way. Instead, there might be some to go around to those who are important because they are affected one way or another by your business. These are your stakeholders.</p>

Stakeholders typically value a leadership team that chooses the ethical way to accomplish the company&#8217;s legitimate for-profit goals. For example, Patagonia expresses its commitment to environmentalism via its &#8220;1% for the Planet&#8221; program, which donates 1 percent of all sales to help save the planet. In part because of this program, Patagonia has become a market leader in outdoor gear.</p>

It may also mean treating our employees, customers, and clients with honesty and respect. It may come from the sense of pride we feel about engaging in honest transactions, not just because the law demands it but because we demand it of ourselves. It may lie in knowing the profit we make does not come from shortchanging others.

</div></div>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm400415824">Nearly all systems of religious belief stress the building blocks of engaging others with respect, empathy, and honesty. These foundational beliefs, in turn, prepare us for the codes of ethical behavior that serve as ideal guides for business and the professions. Still, we need not subscribe to any religious faith to hold that ethical behavior in business is still necessary. Just by virtue of being human, we all share obligations to one another, and principal among these is the requirement that we treat others with fairness and dignity, including in our commercial transactions.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm409734016">For this reason, we use the words <em data-effect="italics">ethics</em> and <em data-effect="italics">morals</em> interchangeably in this book, though some philosophers distinguish between them. We hold that &#8220;an ethical person&#8221; conveys the same sense as &#8220;a moral person,&#8221; and we do not regard religious belief as a requirement for acting ethically in business and the professions. Because we are all humans and in the same world, we should extend the same behavior to all. It is the right way to behave, but it also burnishes our own professional reputation as business leaders of integrity.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm407243696">Integrity&#8212;that is, unity between what we say and what we do&#8212;is a highly valued trait. But it is more than just consistency of character. Acting with <span data-type="term" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_term4" group-by="i">integrity</span> means we adhere strongly to a code of ethics, so it implies trustworthiness and incorruptibility. Being a professional of integrity means consistently striving to be the best person you can be in all your interactions with others. It means you practice what you preach, walk the talk, and do what you believe is right based upon reason. Integrity in business brings many advantages, not the least of which is that it is a critical factor in allowing business and society to function properly.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm397547616">Successful corporate leaders and the companies they represent will take pride in their enterprise if they engage in business with honesty and fair play. To treat customers, clients, employees, and all those affected by a firm with dignity and respect <em data-effect="italics">is</em> ethical. In addition, laudable business practices serve the long-term interests of corporations. Why? Because customers, clients, employees, and society at large will much more willingly patronize a business and work hard on its behalf if that business is perceived as caring about the community it serves. And what type of firm has long-term customers and employees? One whose track record gives evidence of honest business practice.</p>

</div></div>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm404454544">Many people confuse legal and ethical compliance. They are, however, totally different and call for different standards of behavior. The concepts are not interchangeable in any sense of the word. The law is needed to establish and maintain a functioning society. Without it, our society would be in chaos. Compliance with these legal standards is strictly mandatory: If we violate these standards, we are subject to punishment as established by the law. Therefore, <span data-type="term" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_term5" group-by="c">compliance</span> in terms of business ethics generally refers to the extent to which a company conducts its business operations in accordance with applicable regulations, statutes, and laws. Yet this represents only a baseline minimum. Ethical observance builds on this baseline and reveals the principles of an individual business leader or a specific organization. Ethical acts are generally considered voluntary and personal&#8212;often based on our perception of or stand on right and wrong.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm401275728">Some professions, such as medicine and the law, have traditional codes of ethics. The <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_term6" group-by="H">Hippocratic Oath</span>, for example, is embraced by most professionals in health care today as an appropriate standard always owed to patients by physicians, nurses, and others in the field. This obligation traces its lineage to ancient Greece and the physician Hippocrates. Business is different in not having a mutually shared standard of ethics. This is changing, however, as evidenced by the array of codes of conduct and mission statements many companies have adopted over the past century. These have many points in common, and their shared content may eventually produce a code universally claimed by business practitioners. What central point might constitute such a code? Essentially, a commitment to treat with honesty and integrity customers, clients, employees, and others affiliated with a business.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm401372528">The law is typically indebted to tradition and precedence, and compelling reasons are needed to support any change. Ethical reasoning often is more topical and reflects the changes in consciousness that individuals and society undergo. Often, ethical thought precedes and sets the stage for changes in the law.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm397883216">Behaving ethically requires that we meet the mandatory standards of the law, but that is not enough. For example, an action may be legal that we personally consider unacceptable. Companies today need to be focused not only on complying with the letter of the law but also on going above and beyond that basic mandatory requirement to consider their stakeholders and do what is right.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm408534736"><h3 data-type="title">Ends, Means, and Character in Business</h3>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm403332896">How, then, should we behave? Philosophy and science help us answer this question. From philosophy, three different perspectives help us assess whether our decisions are ethical on the basis of reason. These perspectives are called <span data-type="term" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_term7" group-by="n">normative ethical theories</span> and focus on how people ought to behave; we discuss them in this chapter and in later chapters. In contrast, <em data-effect="italics">descriptive ethical theories</em> are based on scientific evidence, primarily in the field of psychology, and describe how people tend to behave within a particular context; however, they are not the subject of this book.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm411127936">The first normative approach is to examine the ends, or <em data-effect="italics">consequences</em>, a decision produces in order to evaluate whether those ends are ethical. Variations on this approach include utilitarianism, teleology, and consequentialism. For example, <span data-type="term" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_term8" group-by="u">utilitarianism</span> suggests that an ethical action is one whose consequence achieves the greatest good for the greatest number of people. So if we want to make an ethical decision, we should ask ourselves who is helped and who is harmed by it. Focusing on consequences in this way generally does not require us to take into account the means of achieving that particular end, however. That fact leads us to the second normative theory about what constitutes ethical conduct.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm399052976">The second approach does examine the <em data-effect="italics">means,</em> or actions, we use to carry out a business decision. An example of this approach is <span data-type="term" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_term9" group-by="d">deontology</span>, which essentially suggests that it is the means that lend nobility to the ends. Deontology contends that each of us owes certain duties to others (<em data-effect="italics">deon</em> is a Greek word for duty or obligation) and that certain universal rules apply to every situation and bind us to these duties. In this view, whether our actions are ethical depends only on whether we adhere to these rules. Thus, the means we use is the primary determinant of ethical conduct. The thinker most closely associated with deontology is the eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_term10" group-by="K">Kant</span> (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_OSX_Ethics_01_01_Kant">Figure 1.3</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm399034368">The third normative approach, typically called <span data-type="term" id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_term11" group-by="v">virtue theory</span>, focuses on the <em data-effect="italics">character</em> of the decision-maker&#8212;a character that reflects the training we receive growing up. In this view, our ethical analysis of a decision is intimately connected with the person we choose to be. It is through the development of habits, the routine actions in which we choose to engage, that we are able to create a character of integrity and make ethical decisions. Put differently, if a two-year-old is taught to take care of and return borrowed toys even though this runs contrary to every instinct they have, they may continue to perfect their ethical behavior so that at age forty, they can be counted on to safeguard the tens of millions of dollars investors have entrusted to their care in brokerages.</p>
<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm403877456">Virtue theory has its roots in the Greek philosophical tradition, whose followers sought to learn how to live a flourishing life through study, teaching, and practice. The cardinal virtues to be practiced were courage, self-control, justice, and wisdom. Socrates was often cited as a sage and a role model, whose conduct in life was held in high regard.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm405022832">By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul id="fs-idm402718400">
<li>Differentiate between short-term and long-term perspectives</li>
<li>Differentiate between <em data-effect="italics">stockholder</em> and <em data-effect="italics">stakeholder</em></li>
<li>Discuss the relationship among ethical behavior, goodwill, and profit</li>
<li>Explain the concept of corporate social responsibility</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm401841264">Few directives in business can override the core mission of maximizing shareholder wealth, and today that particularly means increasing quarterly profits. Such an intense focus on one variable over a short time (i.e., a <span data-type="term" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_term14" group-by="s">short-term perspective</span>) leads to a short-sighted view of what constitutes business success.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm413590048">Measuring true profitability, however, requires taking a long-term perspective. We cannot accurately measure success within a quarter of a year; a longer time is often required for a product or service to find its market and gain traction against competitors, or for the effects of a new business policy to be felt. Satisfying consumers&#8217; demands, going green, being socially responsible, and acting above and beyond the basic requirements all take time and money. However, the extra cost and effort will result in profits in the long run. If we measure success from this longer perspective, we are more likely to understand the positive effect ethical behavior has on all who are associated with a business.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm406810272">Decades ago, some management theorists argued that a conscientious manager in a for-profit setting acts ethically by emphasizing solely the maximization of earnings. Today, most commentators contend that ethical business leadership is grounded in doing right by all stakeholders directly affected by a firm&#8217;s operations, including, but not limited to, <span data-type="term" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_term15" group-by="s">stockholder</span><strong data-effect="bold">s</strong>, or those who own shares of the company&#8217;s stock. That is, business leaders do right when they give thought to what is best for <em data-effect="italics">all</em> who have a stake in their companies. Not only that, firms actually reap greater material success when they take such an approach, especially over the long run.</p>

However, although it is certainly permissible and even desirable for a company to pursue profitability as a goal, managers must also have an understanding of the context within which their business operates and of how the wealth they create can add positive value to the world. The context within which they act is society, which permits and facilitates a firm&#8217;s existence.</c:para>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm406680208">Thus, a company enters a <span data-type="term" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_term17" group-by="s">social contract</span> with society as whole, an implicit agreement among all members to cooperate for social benefits. Even as a company pursues the maximizing of stockholder profit, it must also acknowledge that all of society will be affected to some extent by its operations. In return for society&#8217;s permission to incorporate and engage in business, a company owes a reciprocal obligation to do what is best for as many of society&#8217;s members as possible, regardless of whether they are stockholders. Therefore, when applied specifically to a business, the social contract implies that a company gives back to the society that permits it to exist, benefiting the community at the same time it enriches itself.</p>

While employed at UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s largest bank, Birkenfeld assisted in the company&#8217;s illegal offshore tax business, and he later served forty months in prison for conspiracy. But he was also the original source of incriminating information that led to a Federal Bureau of Investigation examination of the bank and to the U.S. government&#8217;s decision to impose a $780 million fine on UBS in 2009. In addition, Birkenfeld turned over to investigators the account information of more than 4,500 U.S. private clients of UBS.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-002" id="e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3-endNote3"><sup class="os-end-note-number">3</sup></a></c:para>

Wall Street&#8217;s focus on periodic (i.e., quarterly and annual) earnings has led many managers to adopt a short-term perspective, which fails to take into account effects that require a longer time to develop. For example, charitable donations in the form of corporate assets or employees&#8217; volunteered time may not show a return on investment until a sustained effort has been maintained for years.

For many years, Toyota was content to sell its cars at a slight loss because it was accomplishing two business purposes: It was establishing a long-term relationship of trust with those who eventually would become its loyal U.S. customers, and it was attempting to disabuse U.S. consumers of their belief that items made in Japan were cheap and unreliable. The company accomplished both goals by patiently playing its long game, a key aspect of its operational philosophy, &#8220;The Toyota Way,&#8221; which includes a specific emphasis on long-term business goals, even at the expense of short-term profit.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_rf-003" id="e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3-endNote4"><sup class="os-end-note-number">4</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm407027232">What contributes to a corporation&#8217;s positive image over the long term? Many factors contribute, including a reputation for treating customers and employees fairly and for engaging in business honestly. Companies that act in this way may emerge from any industry or country. Examples include Fluor, the large U.S. engineering and design firm; illycaff&#232;, the Italian food and beverage purveyor; Marriott, the giant U.S. hotelier; and Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications retailer. The upshot is that when consumers are looking for an industry leader to patronize and would-be employees are seeking a firm to join, companies committed to ethical business practices are often the first to come to mind.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm409712720">Why should stakeholders care about a company acting above and beyond the ethical and legal standards set by society? Simply put, being ethical is simply good business. A business is profitable for many reasons, including expert management teams, focused and happy employees, and worthwhile products and services that meet consumer demand. One more and very important reason is that they maintain a company philosophy and mission to do good for others.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm401167552">Year after year, the nation&#8217;s most admired companies are also among those that had the highest profit margins. Going green, funding charities, and taking a personal interest in employee happiness levels adds to the bottom line! Consumers want to use companies that care for others and our environment. During the years 2008 and 2009, many unethical companies went bankrupt. However, those companies that avoided the &#8220;quick buck,&#8221; risky and unethical investments, and other unethical business practices often flourished. If nothing else, consumer feedback on social media sites such as Yelp and Facebook can damage an unethical company&#8217;s prospects.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm414154352">Earlier in this chapter, we explained that stakeholders are all the individuals and groups affected by a business&#8217;s decisions. Among these stakeholders are stockholders (or <span data-type="term" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_term20" group-by="s">shareholder</span><strong data-effect="bold">s</strong>), individuals and institutions that own stock (or shares) in a corporation. Understanding the impact of a business decision on the stockholder and various other stakeholders is critical to the ethical conduct of business. Indeed, prioritizing the claims of various stakeholders in the company is one of the most challenging tasks business professionals face. Considering only stockholders can often result in unethical decisions; the impact on all stakeholders must be considered and rationally assessed.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm411257456">Managers do sometimes focus predominantly on stockholders, especially those holding the largest number of shares, because these powerful individuals and groups can influence whether managers keep their jobs or are dismissed (e.g., when they are held accountable for the company&#8217;s missing projected profit goals). And many believe the sole purpose of a business is, in fact, to maximize stockholders&#8217; short-term profits. However, considering only stockholders and short-term impacts on them is one of the most common errors business managers make. It is often in the long-term interests of a business <em data-effect="italics">not</em> to accommodate stockowners alone but rather to take into account a broad array of stakeholders and the long-term and short-term consequences for a course of action.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm412446864">Here is a simple strategy for considering all your stakeholders in practice. Divide your screen or page into three columns; in the first column, list all stakeholders in order of perceived priority (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_OSX_Ethics_01_02_Exercise">Figure 1.5</a>). Some individuals and groups play more than one role. For instance, some employees may be stockholders, some members of the community may be suppliers, and the government may be a customer of the firm. In the second column, list what you think each stakeholder group&#8217;s interests and goals are. For those that play more than one role, choose the interests most directly affected by your actions. In the third column, put the likely impact of your business decision on each stakeholder. This basic spreadsheet should help you identify all your stakeholders and evaluate your decision&#8217;s impact on their interests. If you would like to add a human dimension to your analysis, try assigning some of your colleagues to the role of stakeholders and reexamine your analysis.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm401004240">The positive feeling stakeholders have for any particular company is called <span data-type="term" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_term21" group-by="g">goodwill</span>, which is an important component of almost any business entity, even though it is not directly attributable to the company&#8217;s assets and liabilities. Among other intangible assets, goodwill might include the worth of a business&#8217;s reputation, the value of its brand name, the intellectual capital and attitude of its workforce, and the loyalty of its established customer base. Even being socially responsible generates goodwill. The ethical behavior of managers will have a positive influence on the value of each of those components. Goodwill cannot be earned or created in a short time, but it can be the key to success and profitability.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm401534320">A company&#8217;s name, its corporate logo, and its trademark will necessarily increase in value as stakeholders view that company in a more favorable light. A good reputation is essential for success in the modern business world, and with information about the company and its actions readily available via mass media and the Internet (e.g., on public rating sites such as Yelp), management&#8217;s values are always subject to scrutiny and open debate. These values affect the environment outside and inside the company. The <span data-type="term" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_term22" group-by="c">corporate culture</span>, for instance, consists of shared beliefs, values, and behaviors that create the internal or organizational context within which managers and employees interact. Practicing ethical behavior at all levels&#8212;from CEO to upper and middle management to general employees&#8212;helps cultivate an ethical corporate culture and ethical employee relations.</p>

The second job opportunity is with a nonprofit recognized for a very different culture based on its compassionate approach to employee work-life balance. It also offers the chance to pursue your own professional interests or volunteerism during a portion of every work day. The first job offer pays 20 percent more per year.</p>

When you choose a company with which to do business, what factors influence your choice? Let us say you are looking for a financial advisor for your investments and retirement planning, and you have found several candidates whose credentials, experience, and fees are approximately the same. Yet one of these firms stands above the others because it has a reputation, which you discover is well earned, for telling clients the truth and recommending investments that seemed centered on the clients&#8217; benefit and not on potential profit for the firm. Wouldn&#8217;t this be the one you would trust with your investments?</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm404768448">Or suppose one group of financial advisors has a long track record of giving back to the community of which it is part. It donates to charitable organizations in local neighborhoods, and its members volunteer service hours toward worthy projects in town. Would this group not strike you as the one worthy of your investments? That it appears to be committed to building up the local community might be enough to persuade you to give it your business. This is exactly how a long-term investment in community goodwill can produce a long pipeline of potential clients and customers.</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm397688224">If you truly appreciate the positions of your various stakeholders, you will be well on your way to understanding the concept of <span data-type="term" id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_term23" group-by="c">corporate social responsibility (CSR)</span>. CSR is the practice by which a business views itself within a broader context, as a member of society with certain implicit social obligations and environmental responsibilities. As previously stated, there is a distinct difference between legal compliance and ethical responsibility, and the law does not fully address all ethical dilemmas that businesses face. CSR ensures that a company is engaging in sound ethical practices and policies in accordance with the company&#8217;s culture and mission, above and beyond any mandatory legal standards. A business that practices CSR cannot have maximizing shareholder wealth as its sole purpose, because this goal would necessarily infringe on the rights of other stakeholders in the broader society. For instance, a mining company that disregards its corporate social responsibility may infringe on the right of its local community to clean air and water if it pursues only profit. In contrast, CSR places all stakeholders within a proper contextual framework.</p>
<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm404453808">An additional perspective to take concerning CSR is that ethical business leaders opt to do <em data-effect="italics">good</em> at the same time that they do <em data-effect="italics">well.</em> This is a simplistic summation, but it speaks to how CSR plays out within any corporate setting. The idea is that a corporation is entitled to make money, but it should not only make money. It should also be a good civic neighbor and commit itself to the general prospering of society as a whole. It ought to make the communities of which it is part better at the same time it pursues legitimate profit goals. These ends are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible&#8212;indeed, praiseworthy&#8212;to strive for both. When a company approaches business in this fashion, it is engaging in a commitment to corporate social responsibility.</p>

<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm381714736">By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul id="fs-idm377646448">
<li>Analyze ethical norms and values as they relate to business standards</li>
<li>Explain the doctrine of ethical relativism and why it is problematic</li>
<li>Evaluate the claim that having a single ethical standard makes behaving consistently easier</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm372754192">Business people sometimes apply different ethical standards in different contexts, especially if they are working in a culture different from the one in which they were raised or with coworkers from other traditions. If we look outside ourselves for ethical guidance, relying on the context in which we find ourselves, we can grow confused about what is ethical business behavior. Stakeholders then observe that the messages we send via our conduct lack a consistent ethical core, which can harm our reputation and that of the business. To avoid falling back on <span data-type="term" id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_term24" group-by="e">ethical relativism</span>, a philosophy according to which there is no right or wrong and what is ethical depends solely on the context, we must choose a coherent standard we can apply to all our interactions with others.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm386637232">Some people who adopt multiple ethical standards may choose to exhibit the highest standards with their families, because these are the people they most revere. In a business setting, however, this same person may choose to be an unethical actor whose sole goal is the ruthless accumulation of wealth by any means. Because work and family are not the only two settings in which we live our lives, such a person may behave according to yet another standard to competitors in a sporting event, to strangers on the street, or to those in his or her religious community.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm380610672">Although the ethical standard we adopt is always a choice, certain life experiences can have more profound effects on our choice than others. Among the most formative experiences are family upbringing and cultural traditions, broadly defined here to include religious and ethnic norms, the standard patterns of behavior within the context in which we live. Culture and family also influence each other because the family exists in and responds to its cultural context, as well as providing us with the bedrock for our deepest values. Regardless of this initial coding, however, we can choose the ethical standards we apply in the business context.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm372981984">Why should we choose a single ethical code for all the contexts in which we live? The Greek philosophers and later proponents of the normative ethical theories we discussed earlier would say that if you apply your reason to determine how to behave, it makes rational sense to abide by a single ethical code for all interactions with all persons in all contexts. By doing so, you maximize your ethical behavior no matter who the other party is. Furthermore, you have an internally consistent behavior for all family, friends, customers, clients, and anyone else with whom you interact. Thus, we need not choose different values in different contexts, and when people see us in different situations, they are more likely to trust us because they see we uphold the same values regardless of the context.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm384229840">Indeed, proponents of all the normative ethical theories would insist that the only rational choice is to have a single ethical standard. A deontologist would argue that you should adhere to particular duties in performing your actions, regardless of the parties with whom you interact. A utilitarian would say that any act you take should result in the greatest good for the greatest number. A virtue ethicist would state that you cannot be virtuous if you lack integrity in your behavior toward all.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm370672544">Adopting a consistent ethical standard is both selfless and in the manager&#8217;s self-interest. That is, would-be customers and clients are more likely to seek out a business that treats all with whom it interacts with honesty and fairness, believing that they themselves will be treated likewise by that firm. Similarly, business leaders who treat everyone in a trustworthy manner need never worry that they might not have impressed a potential customer, because they always engage in honorable commercial practices. A single standard of business behavior that emphasizes respect and good service appeals to all.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm356900816">Normative ethics is about discovering right and delineating it from wrong; it is a way to develop the rules and norms we use to guide meaningful decision-making. The ethics in our single code are not relative to the time, person, or place. In this world, we all wear different hats as we go about our daily lives as employees, parents, leaders, students. Being a truly ethical person requires that no matter what hat we wear, we exhibit a single ethical code and that it includes, among others, such universal principles of behavior as honesty, integrity, loyalty, fairness, respect for law, and respect for others.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm381679840">Yet another reason to adopt a universal ethical standard is the transparent character it nurtures in us. If a company&#8217;s leadership insists that it stands for honest business transactions at every turn, it cannot prosecute those who defraud the company and look the other way when its own officers do the same. Stakeholders recognize such hypocrisy and rightly hold it against the business&#8217;s leaders.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm370120160">Business leaders are not limited to only one of the normative ethical theories we have described, however. Virtue theory, utilitarianism, and deontology all have advantages to recommend them. Still, what should not change is a corporate commitment to not make exceptions in its practices when those favor the company at the expense of customers, clients, or other stakeholders.</p>
<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm383044944">Moving from theory to daily life, we can also look at the way our reputation is established by the implicit and explicit messages we send to others. If we adopt ethical relativism, friends, family, and coworkers will notice that we use different standards for different contexts. This lack of consistency and integrity can alter their perception of us and likely damage our reputation.</p>

<p id="auto_16c69a24-cd6f-4786-a670-4741a8ad519a_fs-idm402732080">Ethics sets the standards that govern our personal and professional behavior. To conduct business ethically, we must choose to be a professional of integrity. The first steps are to ask ourselves how we define success and to understand that integrity calls on us to act in a way that is consistent with our words. There is a distinct difference between legal compliance and ethical responsibility, and the law does not fully address all ethical dilemmas that businesses face. Sound ethical practice meets the company&#8217;s culture, mission, or policies above and beyond legal responsibilities. The three normative theories of ethical behavior allow us to apply reason to business decisions as we examine the result (utilitarianism), the means of achieving it (deontology), and whether our choice will help us develop a virtuous character (virtue ethics).</p>

<p id="auto_e8a41020-ee96-490d-a96a-bba8271732d3_fs-idm399113888">A long-term view of business success is critical for accurately measuring profitability. All the company&#8217;s stakeholders benefit from managers&#8217; ethical conduct, which also increases a business&#8217;s goodwill and, in turn, supports profitability. Customers and clients tend to trust a business that gives evidence of its commitment to a positive long-term impact. By exercising corporate social responsibility, or CSR, a business views itself within a broader context, as a member of society with certain implicit social obligations and responsibility for its own effects on environmental and social well-being.</p>

<p id="auto_120db7ac-6145-49c2-bcc6-f466557362b3_fs-idm374660368">The adoption of a single ethical code is the mark of a professional of integrity and is supported by the reasoned approach of each of the normative theories of business ethics. When we consistently maintain the same values regardless of the context, we are more likely to engender trust among those with whom we interact.</p>

<p id="auto_193f2cff-9aaf-4529-a53f-a9d10bf9ae44_fs-idm192743920">From the time of barter to the age of bitcoin, most people engaged in business transactions have sought trust. Without trust, which is a fundamental outcome of ethical behavior, not just business relationships but all relationships would collapse. To develop insight into our own concepts of ethics, this chapter looks at how ethical systems have developed over time, beginning with the distinction between ethics and the law.</p>



<p id="auto_193f2cff-9aaf-4529-a53f-a9d10bf9ae44_fs-idm197327408">Ethics are the standards of behavior to which we hold ourselves accountable in our personal and professional lives. Laws and regulations set the minimal standards by which society lives out those ethical norms. Because laws are minimal standards, it is not uncommon for an act to be legal but generally deemed unethical. The fact is that law and ethics are not always the same. Always, however, they are in dialogue, and each informs the other. The greatest challenge in business decision-making is moving beyond the letter of the law to create a culture of ethics (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_193f2cff-9aaf-4529-a53f-a9d10bf9ae44_OSX_Ethics_02_00_Justice">Figure 2.1</a>).</p>



<p id="auto_193f2cff-9aaf-4529-a53f-a9d10bf9ae44_fs-idm178892560">Can you identify a moment in your life when it was hard to follow your conscience, or your personal morality conflicted with societal norms? What was the nature of the conflict, and how did you approach it?</p>

<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm345988400">It would be hard to overstate the influence of ancient Athens on Western civilization. Athenian achievements in the arts, literature, and government have molded Western consciousness. Perennial themes, such as the search for individual identity and each person&#8217;s place in the world, appear in countless novels and Hollywood screenplays. The role of Athenian ethical theories in philosophy has been profound, and Athenian principles continue to be influential in contemporary philosophy. Ethics, as a form of applied philosophy, was a major focus among the leaders of ancient Athens, particularly teachers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. They taught that ethics was not merely what someone did but who someone was. Ethics was a function of being and, as the guiding principle for dealings with others, it naturally applied as well to the sensitive areas of money and commerce.</p>

For some, that life meant engaging in trade and commerce, thanks to the openness of the new democracy established under the lawgiver Cleisthenes in 508 BCE. Others were drawn to Athens&#8217; incredibly rich architecture, poetry, drama, religious practices, politics, and schools of philosophy. Youth traveled there hoping to study with such brilliant teachers as the mathematicians Archimedes and Pythagoras; dramatists like Sophocles and Euripides; historians Herodotus and Thucydides; Hippocrates, the father of medicine; and, of course, the renowned but enigmatic philosopher Socrates. More than being the equivalent of rock stars of their day, these thinkers, scholars, and artists challenged youth to pursue truth, no matter the cost to themselves or their personal ambitions. These leaders were interested not in fame or even in personal development but in the creation of an ideal society. This was the Golden Age of ancient Greece, whose achievements were so profound and enduring that they have formed the pillars of Western civilization for nearly two and a half millennia.</p>

The human world was thought to be grounded in the natural world but to transcend it in striking ways, the most obvious being humans use of reason and deliberation. Philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle tackled fundamental questions of human existence with such insight that their ideas have remained relevant and universal even at the dawn of artificial intelligence. As British mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead (1861&#8211;1947) observed, &#8220;the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-001" id="2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192-endNote1"><sup class="os-end-note-number">1</sup></a></c:para>

Rather, he equated happiness with human flourishing, which he believed could be attained through the exercise of the function that distinguishes humans from the natural world: reason.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-002" id="2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192-endNote2"><sup class="os-end-note-number">2</sup></a> For Aristotle, reason was supreme and best used to increase not wealth but character. &#8220;But what is happiness?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;If we consider what the function of man is, we find that happiness is a virtuous activity of the soul.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-003" id="2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192-endNote3"><sup class="os-end-note-number">3</sup></a></c:para>

The great task of life, then, is to recognize and pursue happiness, no matter the constraints placed on the individual, the most dramatic of which are suffering and death. Birds and fish have little difficulty achieving their ends, and we can assume that much of this is due to their genetic coding. Because happiness might not be genetically encoded in human beings, they must learn how to be happy. How do they do that? According to Aristotle, <em data-effect="italics">eudaimonia</em> is achieved by leading a virtuous life, which is attained over time. &#8220;Happiness is a kind of activity; and an activity clearly is developed and is not a piece of property already in one&#8217;s possession.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-004" id="2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192-endNote4"><sup class="os-end-note-number">4</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm347859792">Aristotle identified two types of virtues, which the philosophical community of his day agreed were objective and not subjective. The two types were intellectual and moral. Intellectual virtues&#8212;including knowledge (<em data-effect="italics">epist&#7703;m&#275;</em>), wisdom (<em data-effect="italics">soph&#237;&#257;</em>), and, most importantly for Aristotle, prudence (<span data-type="term" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_term29" group-by="p"><em data-effect="italics">phr&#243;n&#275;sis</em></span>), or practical wisdom&#8212;served as guides to behavior; that is, a person acted prudently based on the wisdom gained over time through the ongoing acquisition and testing of knowledge. To give an oversimplified but practical application of Aristotelian thinking, a hiring manager acts prudently when assessing a pool of candidates based on knowledge of their backgrounds and on insight gained after years of working in that role. The manager may even use intuitive reason regarding a candidate, which Aristotle believed was another way of arriving at truth. Understood in this way, the manager&#8217;s intuition is an impression regarding character and someone&#8217;s potential fit in an organization. Among the intellectual virtues, prudence played the major role because it helped individuals avoid excess and deficiency and arrive at the <span data-type="term" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_term30" group-by="g">golden mean</span> between the two. Prudence has been translated as &#8220;common sense&#8221; and &#8220;practical wisdom&#8221; and helps individuals make the right decision in the right way at the right time for the right reason. In Aristotle&#8217;s view, only the truly prudent person could possess all the moral virtues.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_14822">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm340478912">The distinction Aristotle made is that the intellectual virtues are acquired purely through learning, whereas the moral virtues are acquired through practice and the development of habits. In contrast to the intellectual virtues, which focused on external acts, the moral virtues had to do with character. They included courage, self-control, liberality, magnificence, honor, patience, and amiability. Some of these virtues had different meanings in ancient Greece than they do today. &#8220;Liberal,&#8221; for instance, referred not to a political or economic stance but rather to an aspect of personality. Someone would be considered liberal who was open and sharing of him- or herself and his or her talents without fear of rejection or expectation of reciprocity. The paragon of these virtues was the magnanimous individual, someone for whom fame and wealth held little attraction.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-005" id="2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192-endNote5"><sup class="os-end-note-number">5</sup></a> This person had self-knowledge; was not rash, quick to anger, or submissive to others; and acted with self-respect, control, and prudence. The magnanimous individual achieved happiness by leading a life characterized by reason and will. He or she remained in control of self and did not hand over his or her authority&#8212;or moral agency&#8212;to others, whether in judgment or in decision-making. &#8220;So, magnanimity seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues, because it enhances them and is never found apart from them. This makes it hard to be truly magnanimous, because it is impossible without all-round excellence,&#8221; according to Aristotle.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-006" id="2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192-endNote6"><sup class="os-end-note-number">6</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm363858240">The relationship between the intellectual and the moral virtues was not as clear cut as it may appear, however, because Aristotle believed that action preceded character. In other words, the primary way to change character was through consistent, intentional behavior in the direction of virtue. Aristotle gave the example of courage. A person was not courageous first and then went about performing acts of courage. Rather, courage resulted from incremental change, small steps taken over time that molded the person&#8217;s character. It relied on a recognition of justice, so that courage was directed toward the right end. The important task was developing the habit of leading the virtuous life. Anyone could do this; however, it was a discipline that had to be learned and practiced with dedication. We can see that this habit of virtue is especially relevant for business today, when the temptation to conform to an established organizational culture is overwhelming even when that culture may permit and even encourage questionable practices. Add the seductive power of money, and anyone&#8217;s courage might be tested.</p>

A life of virtue, therefore, took place in the economic and political spheres so that others might participate in and benefit from it. In Athenian society, it was important for business to be conducted competently and ethically. Even though Aristotle was suspicious of business, he acknowledged its importance in preserving and nurturing Athenian democracy. He also praised the creation of money to further the goal of justice, so that a shoemaker and a housebuilder, for instance, could trade their wares on an equal basis. Virtue in the marketplace was demonstrated through ethical behavior, according to Aristotle: &#8220;People do in fact seek their own good, and think that they are right to act in this way. It is from this belief that the notion has arisen that such people are prudent. Presumably, however, it is impossible to secure one&#8217;s own good independently of domestic and political science.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-007" id="2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192-endNote7"><sup class="os-end-note-number">7</sup></a> This belief in the public nature of virtue was crucial for the flourishing of the city-state and also has implications for contemporary business, which must consider the individual, organization, industry, and society in its development and planning.</c:para>

Everything in the physical world was somehow less than the ideal, and this included the products of human thought and labor. For example, a cow exists in the physical world as an imperfect and temporary expression of the ideal essence of a cow, what we might call &#8220;cowness.&#8221; (This imperfection accounted for the many variations found in the earthly creature.) Business, as a human invention based on self-interest, also had no appreciable ideal or end. After all, what was the purpose of making money if not having more money? Any end beyond that was not evident. In other words, money existed simply to replicate itself and was fueled by avarice (the love of money) or greed (the love of material goods). &#8220;As for the life of the businessman, it does not give him much freedom of action. Besides, wealth is obviously not the good that we are seeking, because it serves only as a means; i.e., for getting something else,&#8221; said Aristotle.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_rf-012" id="2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192-endNote12"><sup class="os-end-note-number">12</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm348869760">Yet, business had an interesting effect that helped invigorate Athenian life and encouraged those engaged in it to be virtuous (or else risk their reputation). This effect was <em data-effect="italics">association</em>. Business was based on the free and fair exchange of goods, which brought not only items of merchandise into association with each other but also buyers, sellers, and public officials. The way to ensure ethically sound association was through the exercise of prudence, especially in its demand that people act not rashly but deliberately. This deliberative aspect of prudence provided a way for buyers, sellers, and everyone engaged in a transaction to act honorably, which was of the utmost importance. Honor was not only a foundational virtue but the cultural environment in which the ancient world existed. One of the worst offenses anyone could commit, whether man, woman, free, or slave, was to act in a dishonorable way. Of course, although acting deliberately does not guarantee that one is acting honorably, for Athenians, acting in a calculated way was not an indication of dishonor. Dishonorable acts included any that disturbed the basic order (<em data-effect="italics">dik&#275;</em>) of life in which everyone had a role, including the gods.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm344458256">Interestingly, the Aristotelian approach to business did not condemn money making or the accumulation of riches.

Aristotle considered greed an excess that tipped the scales of justice and led to scandal. Money might constitute the bait, but greed causes the person to reach out and grab as much as possible, falling into the trap of scandal. The Greeks considered the exercise of greed an irrational, and therefore ignoble, act. Only attention to honor and deliberative prudence could save someone from acting so foolishly.</p>

Ends and means had to be aligned, particularly in business, which provided people&#8217;s livelihoods and secured the economic health of the city-state. Acting honorably meant trying to be magnanimous in all transactions and rising above obsession with baser instincts. The honorable person was magnanimous, prudent, fair, and interested in self-advancement as long as it did not injure personal integrity or the body politic. The importance of prudence is evident because, said Aristotle, it is &#8220;concerned with human goods, i.e., things about which deliberation is possible; for we hold that it is the function of the prudent man to deliberate well; and nobody deliberates about things that cannot be otherwise, or that are not means toward an end, and that end is a practical good.

This exercise of prudence was part of the cosmic order that ensured the right management of the home, the marketplace, and civilization itself. Similarly, committing fraud or deception to achieve an end, even if that end were good or just, was not considered an honorable act. Only when ends and means were aligned and worked in harmony were those engaged in the transaction considered virtuous.

Citizens often relied on litigation to settle disputes, particularly conflicts over business transactions, contracts, inheritance, and property. Justice existed in three forms, as it does today: legal, commutative, and distributive. In <em data-effect="italics">legal justice</em>, the city-state was responsible for establishing fair laws for the welfare of its citizens. <em data-effect="italics">Commutative justice</em> characterized relationships among individuals. Courts attempted to correct harms inflicted and return what had been unlawfully taken away from plaintiffs. <em data-effect="italics">Distributive justice</em> governed the duty of the city-state to distribute benefits and burdens equitably among the people.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm324878192">We can see these forms of justice at work today in very practical ways. For instance, within the framework of commutative justice, businesses are often held responsible ethically and financially for any harm caused by their products. And distributive justice is debated in such hotly contested issues as corporate and individual tax rates, universal health coverage, state and federal income assistance, subsidized housing, social security eligibility, college tuition aid (e.g., Pell grants), and similar programs designed to create a &#8220;safety net&#8221; for those least fortunate. Some safety net programs have been criticized for their excessive cost, inefficiency, and unfairness to those who pay into them while receiving no benefit or say in their administration.</p>

In classical Confucianism, the practice of virtue constitutes the essence of governance. Differing from Aristotelian virtue (<em data-effect="italics">ar&#234;te</em>), Confucian virtue emphasizes relationships. Aristotle shows how a self-determining person might live well in society. Confucius showed how a relationship-determining person can live well with others. The reasons for this distinction will become clearer throughout the section.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm231219744">As an iconic figure, Confucius had an impact on politics, literature, civil administration, diplomacy, and religion in China. Yet, by most accounts, he considered himself a failure, never having achieved the position and security he sought during his lifetime. However, his story is a testament to the reward of a life lived with integrity and simplicity.</p>

Confucius committed himself to healing the social divisions that were tearing China apart under the declining Zhou Dynasty. Those divisions led to what historians call the &#8220;Period of the Warring States,&#8221; which persisted for two hundred years after Confucius&#8217;s death. It was a time of constant warfare and violence.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-001" id="893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6-endNote16"><sup class="os-end-note-number">16</sup></a> To counter the social disintegration he found everywhere, Confucius looked to the past, or &#8220;the wisdom of the ancients.&#8221; He called for a &#8220;return to <em data-effect="italics"><strong data-effect="bold">li</strong></em>,&#8221; which was the proper order of the universe in which everyone had a role to play and there was harmony in the world.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-002" id="893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6-endNote17"><sup class="os-end-note-number">17</sup></a></c:para>

For Confucius, <em data-effect="italics">li</em> was expressed through ritual acts. When the correct rituals were followed in the right way with the right intention for the right end, all was well. Of course, corporate rituals also exist, and like all ritual acts, they reinforce cohesion and identity within the group. Identifying them helps improve employee awareness, productivity, and, perhaps, happiness. One example of this would be new-employee orientation, which is intended to acclimate newcomers to the corporate culture, the company ethos, and the traditions associated with the way the firm does business. Finally, anticipating Aristotle&#8217;s golden mean, <em data-effect="italics">li</em> emphasized the middle ground between deficiency and excess. &#8220;Nothing in excess&#8221; was its guiding principle.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-003" id="893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6-endNote18"><sup class="os-end-note-number">18</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm237731552">Scholars believe that, like Aristotle, Confucius stressed the virtuous life in his ethical system, with the goal of creating a <span data-type="term" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_term36" group-by="j"><em data-effect="italics">junzi</em></span>, or a person who was gracious, magnanimous, and cultured: in other words, a flourishing human being. A <em data-effect="italics">junzi</em> exhibited refinement, self-control, and balance in all things, acting neither rashly nor timidly. Such a person was the opposite of a &#8220;small&#8221; individual, who spent his or her time embroiled in petty rivalries and for whom power was the ultimate measure of success.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm238691328">The concept of <em data-effect="italics">junzi</em> and the Aristotelian magnanimous individual have much in common, except that for Confucius, there was added urgency. To be a <em data-effect="italics">junzi</em> was a matter not just of honor but of survival. It is no exaggeration to say that China&#8217;s very existence depended upon the ability of individuals&#8212;nobles and peasants alike&#8212;to rise above the barbarity around them and embrace a way of life directed both outward toward social, political, and administrative reform and inward toward spiritual development.

The sincerity Confucius had in mind was closer to loyalty, and the thing to which humans had to be loyal was truth. Confucius intended to counter the blind loyalty that had contributed to the eruption of anarchy throughout China. For instance, if a subject were called upon to offer advice, the subject had to be truthful, even though the ruler might not like the advice, which actually happened to Confucius, causing him to resign his post as minister of justice in Lu.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-008" id="893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6-endNote23"><sup class="os-end-note-number">23</sup></a> What a subject owed the ruler was not cloying deference but the truth, which would benefit everyone in the long run. The implications for ethical behavior in modern corporations may be obvious. Reporting unethical behavior as a whistleblower or even standing up for truth in a meeting is sometimes easier said than done, which is why living virtuously requires disciplined practice and the support of like-minded individuals.</c:para>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm231206976">The &#8220;constant mean&#8221; refers to balance between excess and deficiency in an existential and in a practical sense. We are to follow the middle path, avoiding extremes of thought and action through ritual acts. We cannot claim to lead a balanced life; we must show it by performing acts that maintain personal and collective order. The <em data-effect="italics">Book of Li</em> catalogues many of these acts, which form a guide for proper living, indicating the correct way to maintain the five great relationships that support Chinese society: parent/child, husband/wife, elder/junior sibling, master/apprentice, and ruler/subject. Confucius and his peers believed that properly observing these key five relationships was essential for social good and would invoke divine favor on the people.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_21292">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm228066880">Note that three of these are relationships within the family. The family was the basic unit of society and Confucius&#8217;s hope for reform, because it was the primary and most influential school of character, virtue, and conscience. Thus, the return to <em data-effect="italics">li</em> takes on greater significance than a simple longing for an idyllic past. As Huston Smith noted, &#8220;that three of the Five Relationships pertain within the family is indicative of how important Confucius considered this institution to be. In this he was not inventing but continuing the Chinese assumption that the family is the basic unit of society. This assumption is graphically embedded in Chinese legend, which credits the hero who &#8216;invented&#8217; the family with elevating the Chinese from the animal to human level.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_rf-009" id="893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6-endNote24"><sup class="os-end-note-number">24</sup></a></c:para>

As in ancient Greece, women in ancient China were in charge of domestic duties and care of the family. They were neither expected nor believed able to assume duties outside the home and certainly not in the competitive world of business. Yet consider the fictional case of Yijing.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm234861984">Yijing was the daughter of the merchant Bei Li, who sold farming tools and agricultural products in Cao, which bordered Lu. Bei Li&#8217;s business was very successful and he took great pride in it. He had three sons who worked with him, but none had the head for business that his daughter Yijing had. Moreover, none of them wanted to take over the business after his death. When Yijing begged for a chance to run the business for her father, he agreed, but he insisted she disguise herself as a man when traveling and doing business in the family name. If people knew she was a woman, they would ridicule the family and take advantage of her. Although surprised by her father&#8217;s request, Yijing agreed and eventually took over the business, making it extremely prosperous.</p>

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm234767520">The spirituality that emerges from <em data-effect="italics">quan</em> as righteousness is not solely about the individual; it is about the act itself, that is, the transaction, whether that takes place in a market, shop, or loading dock. When righteousness is directed outward in this way, it becomes justice, compelling all parties in a transaction to act in good faith or risk upsetting the proper order of things. Justice in this sense allows for wealth creation, investment, and strategic planning as long as all fulfill their roles and act in the manner of a <em data-effect="italics">junzi</em>. An overarching spirituality of business may even develop, arising from the people who collectively make up the company. This is a traditionally Confucian way of looking at corporate culture, as the reflection of a larger network of relationships.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm232837088">The other two Confucian ways of humanity also relate to business, because wholeheartedness and sincerity can serve as models of risk assessment, requiring clearheaded thinking and action balanced with respect for markets, competitors, and stakeholders. The <em data-effect="italics">dao</em> of humanity rejects the premise that greed reigns supreme by itself. Instead, its ethical counterpart is truth. Both qualities exist within business practices. In this ethical framework, loyalty to truth is not just a stock phrase but a commitment to value in all aspects of an enterprise, such as sales, finance, marketing, and the employment and hiring chain. An investment advisor might recommend the constant mean to clients so their money is in a diversified portfolio with a long-term strategy.

<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm217537152">Some have criticized Confucianism for impeding progress in China in areas like education, the natural sciences, and business, because it has failed to adapt to the modern context. High-frequency trading, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and robotics do not work with cultural values thousands of years old, these critics say, so what we need is a new consciousness for a new era in human history. However, these criticisms miss the point. Confucius was interested in the same thing that concerned Aristotle&#8212;namely, the character of the person or persons making decisions rather than the decisions themselves. The importance of character has been proven repeatedly through business scandals like Enron, LIBOR, and the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the recent problems of Uber and Volkswagen, in which personal irresponsibility resulted in disaster. Indeed, business schools now offer seminars for executives integrating virtue ethics&#8212;both Aristotelian- and Confucian-inspired models&#8212;in leadership development.</p>

<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm235223152">Given the vastly different cultural and historical settings of ancient Greece and China, you may be surprised to find similarities between the Aristotelian and Confucian systems of virtue ethics.

For Aristotle, control manifested itself through the deliberative process of <em data-effect="italics">phr&#243;n&#275;sis</em>, resulting in virtuous living, harmony, and happiness. This application of practical wisdom was related to self-restraint, or temperance. In Confucian virtue ethics, control was a function of self-regulation; primitive instincts were held at bay and the person gained the capacity and courage to act more humanely (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_OSX_Ethics_02_03_Control">Figure 2.6</a>).

Aristotle placed this locus on individuals, who were called to fulfill their purpose honorably, accepting fate with dignity and aplomb. The basis of this acceptance was reason. For Confucius, reflecting the historical plight of China, the locus was the family, which he envisioned as putting an end to anarchy and setting the nation on its proper course by providing the basic pattern of relationships for personal and professional life. To be sure, family counted for Aristotle just as the individual counted for Confucius, but the emphasis in each system was different. Aristotle acknowledged that &#8220;a solitary man has a hard life, because it is not easy to keep up a continuous activity by oneself; but in company with others and in relation to others it is easier.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-002" id="33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2-endNote29"><sup class="os-end-note-number">29</sup></a></c:para>

A person could not act one way at home and a completely different way in public, especially civic leaders, merchants, teachers, and rulers. The modern tendency to compartmentalize various aspects of ourselves to accommodate circumstances would have puzzled those living in ancient Greece or China. A retail manager who contributes generously to help protect endangered species but thinks nothing of working the sales staff to the point of burnout to achieve monthly goals has not successfully integrated the personal and the professional, for instance, and even poses obstacles to individual happiness and life in the community. Everyone desires efficiency in business, but compartmentalizing our personal and professional ideals can lead to &#8220;dispersed personal accountability&#8221; in an organization and the kind of financial meltdown that occurred, through greed and rule-breaking, in the housing and financial industries and led to the worldwide recession of 2008.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-005" id="33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2-endNote32"><sup class="os-end-note-number">32</sup></a></c:para>

To answer this question, consider the essence of the virtuous person that each ethical system strove to create. For Aristotle, the virtuous person saw the truth in every kind of situation. Once acknowledged and recognized, the truth could not be denied without compromising honor. Similarly, Confucius taught that &#8220;A gentleman will not, for the space of a meal, depart from humanity. In haste and flurry, he adheres to it; in fall and stumble, he adheres by it.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-006" id="33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2-endNote33"><sup class="os-end-note-number">33</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm228173456">Despite the emphasis these systems placed on character, however, character was not ultimately what defined the virtuous individual, family, city-state, or nation. Instead, it was the individual&#8217;s transformation, through education, into a different kind of being who will act virtuously even if no one is watching. When the person concentrates on the means used to achieve an end, eventually the means become a way of life even more important than the end itself. It is not merely that the means must match the end, but that they come to define the virtuous person.</p>

Many business scandals could be avoided if more people understood the value of human capital and the need to see the larger picture; to put it differently: responsibility over profitability.

At the most foundational level, the answer might be yes. As Aristotle noted, ethics is not a science but an art.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-008" id="33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2-endNote35"><sup class="os-end-note-number">35</sup></a> Perhaps the best way to answer the question is to consider the methods used for moral decision-making. This strategy would be in line with Aristotelian and Confucian models if we assume that once they attain insight, most people will follow their conscience and act in reasonable, responsible ways. Methods of decision-making then could be adapted to any context or dilemma. But what constitutes a reasonable, responsible method, and who gets to choose it?</c:para>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm238939920">It is possible that standards of ethical conduct could be created to guide business affairs fairly and justly. Such standards already exist in most industries and professions. The Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) give direction to those working in accounting and finance in the United States. The International Standards Organization offers guidelines and protocols for many industries. Together with governmental regulation, these might serve as the basis for ethical behavior, perhaps even globally. Of course, those fashioning guidelines would have to be sensitive to individual autonomy and national sovereignty, especially when it comes to international jurisdiction, privacy, and human rights. For example, the International Financial Reporting Standards serve as a kind of international GAAP to help companies report financial results in a common accounting language across national boundaries.</p>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm234757360">Despite our best efforts, someone who wishes to conduct business selfishly and unethically always will be drawn to do so unless given a compelling incentive not to. It is evident why Aristotle and Confucius stressed the importance of schooling. Perhaps what is needed now, building on these two ancient approaches, is business education focused on transformation rather than on conformity to guidelines. This proposal touches the core of both Aristotelian and Confucian teachings: training and education. Training and education help internalize in us more altruistic business practices. They also permit greater integration between our personal and professional understandings of the way we should treat friends, family, customers, and clients. No matter the context, we are then encouraged to treat others with honesty and respect, so that even someone certain to get away with the most outrageous corruption or money-laundering scheme would not do it. Why not? Because doing so would be a betrayal of the person&#8217;s conscience and identity. A business education that is truly effective&#8212;one for the twenty-first century&#8212;would produce a graduate who could stand up and say no to that kind of self-betrayal.</p>

The payment violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (1977), which prohibits bribes and kickbacks to foreign officials. Chiquita claimed it was the victim of extortion and had no choice. However, for its actions, it eventually paid $25 million in fines to the U.S. government. In 2007, a group of Colombians filed a lawsuit against the company under the Alien Tort Claims Act, alleging that, because of its illegal payments, Chiquita was &#8220;complicit in extrajudicial killings, torture, forced disappearances, and crimes against humanity&#8221; perpetrated against plantation workers by the guerilla &#8220;death squads.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_rf-009" id="33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2-endNote36"><sup class="os-end-note-number">36</sup></a> The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2015, but the Court declined to hear it.</c:para>

He believed that the concept of good could be reduced to one simple instinct: the search for pleasure and the avoidance of pain. All human behavior could be explained by reference to this basic instinct, which Bentham saw as the key to unlocking the workings of the human mind. He created an ethical system based on it, called <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_term45" group-by="u">utilitarianism</span>. Bentham&#8217;s prot&#233;g&#233;, John Stuart Mill (1806&#8211;1873), refined Bentham&#8217;s system by expanding it to include human rights. In so doing, Mill reworked Bentham&#8217;s utilitarianism in some significant ways. In this section we look at both systems.</p>

His ethical system was an attempt to quantify happiness and the good so they would meet the conditions of the scientific method. Ethics had to be empirical, quantifiable, verifiable, and reproducible across time and space. Just as science was beginning to understand the workings of cause and effect in the body, so ethics would explain the causal relationships of the mind. Bentham rejected religious authority and wrote a rebuttal to the Declaration of Independence in which he railed against natural rights as &#8220;rhetorical nonsense, nonsense upon stilts.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-002" id="55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2-endNote38"><sup class="os-end-note-number">38</sup></a> Instead, the fundamental unit of human action for him was <em data-effect="italics">utility</em>&#8212;solid, certain, and factual.</c:para>

Utilitarianism, therefore, emphasizes the consequences or ultimate purpose of an act rather than the character of the actor, the actor&#8217;s motivation, or the particular circumstances surrounding the act. It has these characteristics: (1) universality, because it applies to all acts of human behavior, even those that appear to be done from altruistic motives; (2) objectivity, meaning it operates beyond individual thought, desire, and perspective; (3) rationality, because it is not based in metaphysics or theology; and (4) quantifiability in its reliance on utility.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-003" id="55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2-endNote39"><sup class="os-end-note-number">39</sup></a></c:para>

He generously donated half his estate to London University, a public university open to all and offering a secular curriculum, unusual for the times. (It later became University College London.) Bentham also stipulated that his body be preserved for medical instruction (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_OSX_Ethics_02_04_Bentham">Figure 2.7</a>) and later placed on display in what he called an &#8220;auto-icon,&#8221; or self-image. The university agreed, and Bentham&#8217;s body has been on display ever since. Bentham wanted to show the importance of donating one&#8217;s remains to medical science in what was also perhaps his last act of defiance against convention.

The implications of such a system on law and public policy were profound and had a direct effect on his work with the British House of Commons, where he was commissioned by the Speaker to decide which bills would come up for debate and vote.

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm227841728">Utilitarianism is a consequentialist theory. In <span data-type="term" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_term48" group-by="c">consequentialism</span>, actions are judged solely by their consequences, without regard to character, motivation, or any understanding of good and evil and separate from their capacity to create happiness and pleasure. Thus, in utilitarianism, it is the consequences of our actions that determine whether those actions are right or wrong. In this way, consequentialism differs from Aristotelian and Confucian virtue ethics, which can accommodate a range of outcomes as long as the character of the actor is ennobled by virtue. For Bentham, character had nothing to do with the utility of an action. Everyone sought pleasure and avoided pain regardless of personality or morality. In fact, too much reliance on character might obscure decision-making. Rather than making moral judgments, utilitarianism weighed acts based on their potential to produce the most good (pleasure) for the most people. It judged neither the good nor the people who benefitted. In Bentham&#8217;s mind, no longer would humanity depend on inaccurate and outdated moral codes. For him, utilitarianism reflected the reality of human relationships and was enacted in the world through legislative action.</p>

No doubt, Mill&#8217;s early life and formation had a great deal to do with his championing of individual freedom. He believed the effort to achieve utility was unjustified if it coerced people into doing things they did not want to do. Likewise, the appeal to science as the arbiter of truth would prove just as futile, he believed, if it did not temper facts with compassion. &#8220;Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the inward forces which make it a living thing,&#8221; he wrote.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-013" id="55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2-endNote49"><sup class="os-end-note-number">49</sup></a> Mill was interested in humanizing Bentham&#8217;s system by ensuring that everyone&#8217;s rights were protected, particularly the minority&#8217;s, not because rights were God given but because that was the most direct path to truth.

His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.&#8221; <a data-type="cite" href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_rf-014" id="55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2-endNote50"><sup class="os-end-note-number">50</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm231343312">To be sure, there are limitations to Mill&#8217;s version of utilitarianism, just as there were with the original. For one, there has never been a satisfactory definition of &#8220;harm,&#8221; and what one person finds harmful another may find beneficial. For Mill, harm was defined as the set back of one&#8217;s interests. Thus, harm was defined relative to an individual&#8217;s interests. But what role, if any, should society play in defining what is harmful or in determining who is harmed by someone&#8217;s actions? For instance, is society culpable for not intervening in cases of suicide, euthanasia, and other self-destructive activities such as drug addiction? These issues have become part of the public debate in recent years and most likely will continue to be as such actions are considered in a larger social context. We may also define intervention and coercion differently depending on where we fall on the political spectrum.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm234610096">Considering the social implications of an individual action highlights another limitation of utilitarianism, and one that perhaps makes more sense to us than it would to Bentham and Mill, namely, that it makes no provision for emotional or cognitive harm. If the harm is not measurable in physical terms, then it lacks significance. For example, if a reckless driver today irresponsibly exceeds the speed limit, crashes into a concrete abutment, and kills himself while totaling his vehicle (which he owns), utilitarianism would hold that in the absence of physical harm to others, no one suffers except the driver. We may not arrive at the same conclusion. Instead, we might hold that the driver&#8217;s survivors and friends, along with society as a whole, have suffered a loss. Arguably, all of us are diminished by the recklessness of his act.</p>

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm237856336">Utilitarianism is used frequently when business leaders make critical decisions about things like expansion, store closings, hiring, and layoffs. They do not necessarily refer to a &#8220;utilitarian calculus,&#8221; but whenever they take stock of what is to be gained and what might be lost in any significant decision (e.g., in a cost-benefit analysis), they make a utilitarian determination. At the same time, one might argue that a simple cost-benefits analysis is not a utilitarian calculus unless it includes consideration of all stakeholders and a full accounting of externalities, worker preferences, potentially coercive actions related to customers, or community and environmental effects.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm223309104">As a practical way of measuring value, Bentham&#8217;s system also plays a role in risk management. The utility function, or the potential for benefit or loss, can be translated into decision-making, risk assessment, and strategic planning. Together with data analytics, market evaluations, and financial projections, the utility function can provide managers with a tool for measuring the viability of prospective projects. It may even give them an opportunity to explore objections about the mechanistic and impractical nature of <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_term52" group-by="u">utilitarianism</span>, especially from a customer perspective.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm231554368">Utilitarianism could motivate individuals within the organization to take initiative, become more responsible, and act in ways that enhance the organization&#8217;s reputation rather than tarnish it. Mill&#8217;s <em data-effect="italics">On Liberty</em> (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_OSX_Ethics_02_04_Liberty">Figure 2.8</a>), a short treatment of political freedoms in tension with the power of the state, underscored the importance of expression and free speech, which Mill saw not as one right among many but as the foundational right, reflective of human nature, from which all others rights derive their meaning. And therein lay the greatest utility for society and business. For Mill, the path to utility led through truth, and the main way of arriving at truth was through a deliberative process that encouraged individual expression and the clash of ideas.</p>

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm231480768">As for Mill&#8217;s harm principle, the first question in trying to arrive at a business decision might be, does this action harm others? If the answer is yes, we must make a utilitarian calculation to decide whether there is still a greater good for the greatest number. Then we must ask, who are the others we must consider? All stakeholders? Only shareholders? What does harm entail, and who decides whether a proposed action might be harmful? This was the reason science and debate were so important to Mill, because the determination could not be left to public opinion or intuition. That was how tyranny started. By introducing deliberation, Mill was able to balance utility with freedom, which was a necessary condition for utility.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm232860112">Where Bentham looked to numerical formulas for determining value, relying on the objectivity of numbers, Mill sought value in reason and in the power of language to clarify where truth lies. The lesson for contemporary business, especially with the rise of big data, is that we need both numbers and reasoned principles. If we apply the Aristotelian and Confucian rule of the mean, we see that balance of responsibility and profitability makes the difference between sound business practices and poor ones.</p>

What was that truth? What was sufficient to constitute it? Kant identified an a priori world of knowledge and understanding in which truth lay in the structures and categories of the mind that were beyond perception and reason. This was a radical concept for the times.</p>

The existence of the mental structures he proposed has even been confirmed today. For instance, the scientific consensus is that humans are born with cognitive structures designed specifically for language acquisition and development. Even more surprising, there may be similar cognitive structures for morality, conscience, and moral decision-making.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-005" id="11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b-endNote55"><sup class="os-end-note-number">55</sup></a> So, it is quite possible that conscience, if not happiness, may have a genetic component after all, although Kant himself did not believe the categories of the understanding or the a priori structures of the mind were biological.</c:para>

<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm235789040">From a Kantian perspective, it is clear that adherence to duty is what builds the framework for ethical acts. This is in direct contradiction of Bentham&#8217;s view of human nature as selfish and requiring an objective calculus for ethical action to result. Kant rejected the idea of such a calculus and believed, instead, that perceptions were organized into preexisting categories or structures of the mind. Compare his notion of an ordered and purposeful universe of laws with the similar <em data-effect="italics">logos</em>, or logic, of the ancient Greeks. One of those laws included implementation of the categorical imperative to act ethically, in accordance with our conscience. However, even though that imperative ought to be followed without exception, not everyone does so. In Kant&#8217;s moral teachings, individuals still had free will to accept or reject it.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_22470">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm235434704">There is a definite contrast between utilitarianism, even Mill&#8217;s version, and Kant&#8217;s system of ethics, known as <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_term56" group-by="d">deontology</span>, in which duty, obligation, and good will are of the highest importance. (The word is derived from the Greek <em data-effect="italics">deon</em>, meaning duty, and <em data-effect="italics">logos</em> again, here meaning organization for the purpose of study.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-006" id="11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b-endNote56"><sup class="os-end-note-number">56</sup></a>) An ethical decision requires us to observe only the rights and duties we owe to others, and, in the context of business, act on the basis of a primary motive to do what is right by all stakeholders. Kant was not concerned with utility or outcome&#8212;his was not a system directed toward results. The question for him was not how to attain happiness but how to become worthy of it.</c:para>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm223185232">Rather like Aristotle and Confucius, Kant taught that the transcendent aspects of human nature, if followed, would lead us inevitably to treat people as ends rather than means. To be moral meant to renounce uninformed dogmatism and rationalism, abide by the categorical imperative, and embrace freedom, moral sense, and even divinity. This was not a lofty or unattainable goal in Kant&#8217;s mind, because these virtues constituted part of the systematic structuring of the human mind. It could be accomplished by living truthfully or, as we say today, authentically. Such a feat transcended the logic of both rationalism and empiricism.</p>

The main character, Jean Valjean, steals a loaf of bread to feed his sister&#8217;s starving family and is arrested and sent to prison. If we apply conventional reasoning and principles of law to his crime, Valjean genuinely is guilty as charged and we do not need to consider any extenuating circumstances. However, in a Kantian ethical framework, we would take into account Valjean&#8217;s motives as well as his duty to treat his sister&#8217;s family as ends in themselves who deserve to live. Valjean&#8217;s fate demonstrates what might occur when there is a gap between the legal and the moral. Clearly, Valjean broke the law by stealing the bread. However, he acted morally by correcting a wrong and possibly saving human lives. According to Kantian ethics, Valjean may have been ethical in stealing bread for his family, particularly because the action was grounded in good will and provided benefit to others more than to himself.</p>

On one hand, it offers a unique opportunity for the development of individual morality through the categorical imperative to act ethically, which emphasizes humanity and autonomy.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-007" id="11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b-endNote57"><sup class="os-end-note-number">57</sup></a> This imperative addresses one major side of business ethics: the personal. Character and moral formation are crucial to creating an ethical culture.

Recent examples include Uber, where a toxic work environment was allowed to prevail, and Volkswagen, which knowingly misrepresented the emissions level of its cars.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-008" id="11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b-endNote58"><sup class="os-end-note-number">58</sup></a> Such examples exist in government as well, as the recent Theranos and &#8220;Fat Leonard&#8221; scandals confirm.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-009" id="11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b-endNote59"><sup class="os-end-note-number">59</sup></a> The latter consisted of graft and corruption in the U.S. Navy&#8217;s Pacific fleet and has been a continual source of embarrassment for an institution that prides itself on the honorable conduct of its officers.

It calls for morally upright behavior regardless of external circumstance or the historical context of a proposed act or decision. Kant affirmed that &#8220;the moral law is an imperative, which commands categorically, because the law is unconditioned.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_rf-010" id="11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b-endNote60"><sup class="os-end-note-number">60</sup></a> Unconditional ethics could be a challenge for a global organization dealing with suppliers, customers, and competitors in sometimes vastly different cultures. It raises a larger philosophical issue: namely, was Kant correct in believing that morality and mental categories are independent of experience? Or can they be culturally conditioned, and, if so, does that make them relative rather than absolute, as Kant believed them to be?</c:para>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm237501168">This question whether ethics is universal is distinctly Kantian, because Kant believed that not only must a moral agent act with others&#8217; interests in mind and have the right intentions, but also that the action be universally applicable. Think of how Kantian ethics might be applied not just on an individual level but throughout an organization, and then society. Kant would judge a corporate act to be ethical if it benefitted others at the same time it benefitted company leadership and stockholders, and if it did not place their interests above those of other stakeholders. If loyalty to a coworker conflicted with loyalty to a supervisor or the organization, for instance, then acts resulting from such loyalty might not meet the conditions of deontology. Either the supervisor or the company would be treated as a means rather than an end. Although the qualitative or humanizing element of Kantian ethics has broad appeal, it runs into limitations in an actual business setting. Whether the limitations have good or bad effects depends on the organization&#8217;s culture and leadership. In general, however, most companies do not adhere to strict Kantian theories, because they look to the outcome of their decisions rather than focusing on motives or intentions.</p>

Initially, the company denied there were any technical problems. Then, when it became obvious the exploding phones posed a safety and health threat (they were banned from airplanes), Samsung accused its suppliers of creating the problem. In reality, the rush to beat Apple&#8217;s iPhone 7 release date was the most likely reason corners were cut in production. Samsung finally owned up to the problem, recalled more than two million phones worldwide, and replaced them with new, improved Galaxy Note 7s.</p>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm235396784">The company&#8217;s response and its replacement of the phones went a long way toward defusing the disaster and even boosting the company&#8217;s share price. Whether management knew it, its response was Kantian. Samsung focused on the end (i.e., customer safety and satisfaction) with the motive of doing the ethically responsible thing. Although some might argue the company could have done far more and much more quickly, perhaps it still acted in accordance with the categorical imperative. What do you think?</p>

<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm223400592">Rawls developed a theory of justice based on the Enlightenment ideas of thinkers like John Locke (1632&#8211;1704) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712&#8211;1778), who advocated <span data-type="term" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_term60" group-by="s">social contract theory</span>. Social contract theory held that the natural state of human beings was freedom, but that human beings will rationally submit to some restrictions on their freedom to secure their mutual safety and benefit, not subjugation to a monarch, no matter how benign or well intentioned. This idea parallels that of Thomas Hobbes (1588&#8211;1679), who interpreted human nature to be selfish and brutish to the degree that, absent the strong hand of a ruler, chaos would result. So people willingly consent to transfer their autonomy to the control of a sovereign so their very lives and property will be secured. Rousseau rejected that view, as did Rawls, who expanded social contract theory to include justice as fairness. In <em data-effect="italics">A Theory of Justice</em> (1971), Rawls introduced a universal system of fairness and a set of procedures for achieving it. He advocated a practical, empirically verifiable system of governance that would be political, social, and economic in its effects.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_61399">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm237258800">Rawls&#8217;s justice theory contains three principles and five procedural steps for achieving fairness. The principles are (1) an &#8220;original position,&#8221; (2) a &#8220;veil of ignorance,&#8221; and (3) unanimity of acceptance of the original position.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-001" id="23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484-endNote61"><sup class="os-end-note-number">61</sup></a> By <span data-type="term" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_term61" group-by="o">original position</span>, Rawls meant something akin to Hobbes&#8217; understanding of the state of nature, a hypothetical situation in which rational people can arrive at a contractual agreement about how resources are to be distributed in accordance with the principles of justice as fairness. This agreement was intended to reflect not present reality but a desired state of affairs among people in the community. The <span data-type="term" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_term62" group-by="v">veil of ignorance</span> (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_OSX_Ethics_02_06_Veil">Figure 2.10</a>) is a condition in which people arrive at the original position imagining they have no identity regarding age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, physical attractiveness, or other characteristics. In this way, they reduce their bias and self-interest. Last, <span data-type="term" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_term63" group-by="u">unanimity of acceptance</span> is the requirement that all agree to the contract before it goes into effect. Rawls hoped this justice theory would provide a minimum guarantee of rights and liberties for everyone, because no one would know, until the veil was lifted, whether they were male, female, rich, poor, tall, short, intelligent, a minority, Roman Catholic, disabled, a veteran, and so on.</c:para>

The steps also supported his belief in people&#8217;s instinctual drive for fairness and equitable treatment. Perhaps this is best seen in an educational setting, for example, the university. By matriculating, students enter into a contract that includes basic freedoms such as assembly and speech. Students at a disadvantage (e.g., those burdened with loans, jobs, or other financial constraints) are accommodated as well as possible. The contract between the university and students has proven to be stable over time, from generation to generation. This same procedure applies on a micro level to the experience in the classroom between an individual teacher and students. Over the past several decades&#8212;for better or worse&#8212;the course syllabus has assumed the role of a written contract expressing this relationship.</c:para>

<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_7916">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm223389552">Part of Rawls&#8217;s critique of utilitarianism is that its utility calculus can lead to tyranny. If we define pleasure as that which is popular, the minority can suffer in terrible ways and the majority become mere numbers. This became clear in Mills&#8217;s attempt to humanize Bentham&#8217;s calculus. But Mills&#8217;s harm principle had just as bad an effect, for the opposite reason. It did not require anyone to give up anything if it had to be done through coercion or force. To extend Rawls&#8217;s cake example, if one person owned a bakery and another were starving, like Jean Valjean&#8217;s sister in <em data-effect="italics">Les Mis&#233;rables</em>, utilitarianism would force the baker to give up what he had to satisfy the starving person without taking into account whether the baker had greater debts, a sick spouse requiring medical treatment, or a child with educational loans; in other words, the <em data-effect="italics">context</em> of the situation matters, as opposed to just the consequences. However, Mill&#8217;s utilitarianism, adhering to the harm principle, would leave the starving person to his or her own devices. At least he or she would have one slice of cake. This was the problem of distribution and redistribution that Rawls hoped to solve, not by calculating pleasure and pain, profit and loss, but by applying fairness as a normative value that would benefit individuals and society.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-005" id="23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484-endNote65"><sup class="os-end-note-number">65</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm234884784">The problem with this approach is that justice theory is a radical, egalitarian form of liberalism in which redistribution of material goods and services occurs without regard for historical context or the presumption many share that it inherently is wrong to take the property legally acquired by one and distribute it to another. Rawls has been criticized for promoting the same kind of coercion that can exist in utilitarianism but on the basis of justice rather than pleasure. Justice on a societal level would guarantee housing, education, medical treatment, food, and the basic necessities of life for everyone. Yet, as recent political campaigns have shown, the question of who will pay for these guaranteed goods and services through taxes is a contentious one. These are not merely fiscal and political issues; they are philosophical ones requiring us to answer questions of logic and, especially in the case of justice theory, fairness. And, naturally, we must ask, what is fair?</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_62275">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm232209632">Rawls&#8217;s principles and steps assume that the way in which the redistribution of goods and services occurs would be agreed upon by people in the community to avoid any fairness issues. But questions remain. For one, Rawls&#8217;s justice, like the iconic depiction, is blind and cannot see the circumstances in which goods and services are distributed. Second, we may question whether a notion of fairness is really innate. Third, despite the claim that justice theory is not consequentialist (meaning outcomes are not the only thing that matters), there is a coercive aspect to Rawls&#8217;s justice once the contract is in force, replacing utility with mandated fairness. Fourth, is this the kind of system in which people thrive and prosper, or, by focusing on the worst off, are initiative, innovation, and creativity dampened on the part of everyone else? Perhaps the most compelling critic of Rawls in this regard was his colleague at Harvard University, Robert Nozick (1938&#8211;2002), who wrote <em data-effect="italics">A Theory of Entitlement</em> (1974) as a direct rebuttal of Rawlsian justice theory.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_rf-006" id="23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484-endNote66"><sup class="os-end-note-number">66</sup></a> Nozick argued that the power of the state may never ethically be used to deprive someone of property he or she has legally obtained or inherited in order to distribute it to others who are in need of it.</c:para>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm232535312">Still, one of the advantages of justice theory over the other ethical systems presented in this chapter is its emphasis on method as opposed to content. The system runs on a methodology or process for arriving at truth through the underlying value of fairness. Again, in this sense it is similar to utilitarianism, but, by requiring unanimity, it avoids the extremes of Bentham&#8217;s and Mill&#8217;s versions. As a method in ethics, it can be applied in a variety of ways and in multiple disciplines, because it can be adapted to just about any value-laden content. Of course, this raises the question of content versus method in ethics, especially because ethics has been defined as a set of cultural norms based on agreed-upon values. Method may be most effective in determining what those underlying values are, rather than how they are implemented.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm223267056"><h3 data-type="title">Justice in Business</h3>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm227847040">Although no ethical framework is perfect or fits a particular era completely, Rawls&#8217;s justice theory has distinct advantages when applied to business in the twenty-first century. First, as businesses become interdependent and globalized, they must pay more attention to quality control, human resources, and leadership in diverse settings. What will give greater legitimacy to an organization in these areas than fairness? Fairness is a value that is cross-cultural, embraced by different social groups, and understood by nearly everyone. However, what is considered fair depends on a variety of factors, including underlying values and individual characteristics like personality. For instance, not everyone agrees on whether or how diversity ought to be achieved. Neither is there consensus about affirmative action or the redistribution of resources or income. What is fair to some may be supremely unfair to others. This presents an opportunity for engaged debate and participation among the members of Rawls&#8217;s community.</p>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm237111296">Second, as we saw earlier, justice theory provides a method for attaining fairness, which could make it a practical and valuable part of training at all levels of a company. The fact that its content&#8212;justice and fairness&#8212;is more accessible to contemporary people than Confucian virtue ethics and more flexible than Kant&#8217;s categorical imperative makes it an effective way of dealing with stakeholders and organizational culture.</p>
<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm237669440">Justice theory may also provide a seamless way of engaging in corporate social responsibility outwardly and employee development inwardly. Fairness as a corporate doctrine can be applied to all stakeholders and define a culture of trust and openness, with all the corresponding benefits, in marketing, advertising, board development, client relations, and so on. It is also an effective way of integrating business ethics into the organization so ethics is no longer seen as the responsibility solely of the compliance department or legal team. Site leaders and middle managers understand fairness; employees probably even more so, because they are more directly affected by the lack of it. Fairness, then, is as much part of the job as it is an ongoing process of an ethics system. It no doubt makes for a happier and more productive workforce. An organization dedicated to it can also play a greater role in civic life and the political process, which, in turn, helps everyone.</p>

<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm366892000">The role of ethics in Athens during Greece&#8217;s Golden Age (fifth century BCE) was substantial. Aristotle focused on the role of virtue in developing individual character and social stability. He believed a person&#8217;s actions determined whether he or she was virtuous, and the point of the virtuous life was happiness, or <em data-effect="italics">eudaimonia</em>.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm324836448">Aristotle identified two types of virtues: intellectual and moral. Intellectual virtues were acquired through learning and served as guides to behavior by helping the individual discover truth. Moral virtues were acquired through habit and built character by helping someone pursue what is beneficial and avoid what is harmful in daily life. Aristotle considered <em data-effect="italics">phr&#243;n&#275;sis</em>, or prudence, the most important virtue, because of its practical application.</p>
<p id="auto_2aeebf6c-f671-435f-8fdb-5717ae1a6192_fs-idm341665280">The thirteenth-century philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that to act dishonorably casts disrepute on all concerned. Ends and means had to be aligned, particularly in business, which provided people&#8217;s livelihoods and secured the economic health of the city-state.</p>

His system of virtue ethics emphasized relationships and, when followed faithfully, led to the <em data-effect="italics">dao</em> of humanity, that is, true harmonious living. There were three ways to achieve <em data-effect="italics">dao</em>: &#8220;whole-hearted sincerity and truthfulness,&#8221; the &#8220;constant mean,&#8221; and &#8220;expediency&#8221; (<em data-effect="italics">quan</em>). Someone who lived virtuously became more humane, which resulted in a flourishing individual and an ordered nation.</p>
<p id="auto_893cd8d2-719b-4993-8d47-438c356d38d6_fs-idm229408096">In Confucian virtue ethics, business was viewed as a network of relationships dependent on trust and righteousness. Righteousness was a form of justice that compelled everyone to act in good faith. Considered in this way, justice allows for wealth creation, investment, and strategic planning as long as everyone fulfills his or her role and acts in accordance with the basic pattern of relationships Confucius identified.</p>

<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm237971840">Aristotle and Confucius each constructed an ethical system based on virtue, with Aristotle&#8217;s anticipated result being happiness and Confucius&#8217;s being harmony. For Aristotle, happiness consisted of the search for truth. Confucius looked to create a system that put an end to civil chaos. Although both systems relied on reason and control to achieve their ends, Aristotle placed the locus of ethical behavior on individuals, but he held that a moral upbringing and good political governance also contributed to the formation of moral character. Confucius saw this locus in the family, which provided the basic pattern of relationships for personal and professional life. Reason prevailed throughout, as in the cultivation of a more just and humane person.</p>
<p id="auto_33787ae5-1db5-4ea4-8744-be5f41b0e4e2_fs-idm227880672">In a business context, reason and control bear directly on management, leadership, and corporate culture. They constitute a way of cultivating individual virtue and corporate ethos such that the two go hand in hand. The environment or culture of an organization needs individuals of character who can follow their conscience and experience moral conversion. We might envision the emergence of universal values like reason and control that nurture both the individual and the organization.</p>

<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm234878352">Jeremy Bentham developed a quantifiable method for determining what was beneficial and what was detrimental. He called this method utilitarianism, because its basic unit, the &#8220;util,&#8221; acted like a monetary unit. Bentham&#8217;s prot&#233;g&#233;, John Stuart Mill, refined this system to include human rights. His &#8220;harm principle&#8221; is an outstanding element in his version of utilitarianism.</p>
<p id="auto_55bfe7ca-b4cb-42a3-b4b3-7f66155b4ef2_fs-idm223400624">Utilitarianism in business can lead to a bottom-line mentality in which decisions are based on achieving the greatest good for the organization as it pertains to the greatest number of stakeholders, including shareholders and all others affected by the actions of the organization The outcome is the determining factor, not the intent of the actors or whether people are treated humanely.</p>

<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm232058880">Rejecting dogmatic thinking of all kinds, Kant believed people were not the sum total of reactions to stimuli but complex beings with innate structures of understanding and inborn moral sensitivity. In his view, everyone had a duty to obey a categorical imperative to do the just and moral thing, regardless of the consequences. The outcome of an act was not as important as the intent of the actor and whether the act treated others as ends or means. Here, Kant reflected Aristotelian virtue ethics in seeing people as ends in themselves and not as &#8220;living tools&#8221; or human resources.</p>
<p id="auto_11d573a5-7790-409e-9a78-0b00ae9fd49b_fs-idm231323552">This view does not typically govern most management decisions in business; arguably, utilitarianism is the efficient, go-to theory on which corporate leaders often rely. Yet a Kantian understanding of business ethics remains viable even today and sometimes displays itself in the most compassionate and humane actions that evolving commercial organizations take.</p>

<p id="auto_23762c85-873e-484b-a114-53e050c2b484_fs-idm234828112">Rawls developed a theory of justice based on social contract theory, holding that the natural state of human beings is freedom, not subjugation to a monarch, no matter how benign or well intentioned. Rawls&#8217;s theory views human beings as inherently good and, echoing Kant, inclined toward moral rectitude and action. In his theory, Rawls included the &#8220;veil of ignorance,&#8221; which ensures objectivity in our choices and the avoidance of bias. Criticism of Rawls&#8217;s theory focuses primarily on the issue of distribution, because decisions made in ignorance can neither reward innovation and enterprise nor encourage risk.</p>

<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm340816384">Many individuals and groups inside and outside a business have an interest in the way it brings products or services to market to turn a profit. These stakeholders include customers, clients, employees, shareholders, communities, the environment, the government, and the media (traditional and social), among others. All stakeholders should be considered essential to a business, but not all have equal priority. Different groups of stakeholders carry different weights with decision makers in companies and assert varying levels of interest and influence. As we examine their roles, consider how an organization benefits by working with its stakeholders and how it may benefit from encouraging stakeholders to work together to promote their mutual interests.</p>
<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm333606480">What are the roles of an organization&#8217;s many stakeholders? We begin with the internal stakeholders. The board of directors&#8212;in a company large enough to have one&#8212;is responsible for defining and evaluating the ongoing mission of a business after its founding. It broadly oversees decisions about the mission and direction of the business, the products or services offered, the markets in which the business will operate, and salary and benefits for the senior officers of the organization. The board also sets goals for income and profitability. Its most important function is to select and hire the chief executive officer (CEO) or president. The CEO is usually the only employee who reports directly to the board of directors, and he or she is charged with implementing the policies the board sets and consulting with them on significant issues pertaining to the company, such as a dramatic shift in products or services offered or discussions to acquire&#8212;or be acquired by&#8212;another firm.</p>
<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm363658416">In turn, the CEO hires executives to lead initiatives and carry out procedures in the various functional areas of the business, such as finance, sales and marketing, public relations, manufacturing, quality control, human resources (sometimes called human capital), accounting, and legal compliance. Employees in these areas are internal stakeholders in the success of both their division and the larger corporation. Some interact with the outside environment in which the business operates and serve as contact points for external stakeholders, such as media and government, as well.</p>
<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm373933952">In terms of external stakeholders for a business, customers certainly are an essential group. They need to be able to trust that products and services are backed by the integrity of the company. They also provide reviews, positive or negative, and referrals. Customers&#8217; perceptions of the business matter, too. Those who learn that a business is not treating employees fairly, for instance, may reconsider their loyalty or even boycott the business to try to influence change in the organization. Stakeholder relationships, good and bad, can have compound effects, particularly when social media can spread word of unethical behavior quickly and widely.</p>
<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm378921408">Key external stakeholders are usually those outside of the organization who most directly influence a business&#8217;s bottom line and hold power over the business. Besides customers and clients, suppliers have a great deal of influence and command a great deal of attention from businesses of all sizes. Governments hold power through regulatory bodies, from federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency to the local planning and zoning boards of the communities in which businesses exist. These latter groups often exercise influence over the physical spaces where businesses work and try to grow (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_OSX_Ethics_03_01_PolStakes">Figure 3.2</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm346663776">Businesses are responsible to their stakeholders. Every purchase of a product or a service carries with it a sort of promise. Buyers promise that their money or credit is good, and businesses promise a level of quality that will deliver what is advertised. The relationship can quickly get more complex, though. Stakeholders also may demand that the businesses they patronize give back to the local community or protect the global environment while developing their products or providing services. Employees may demand a certain level of remuneration for their work. Governments demand that companies comply with laws, and buyers in business-to-business exchanges (B2B, in business jargon) demand not only high-quality products and services but on-time delivery and responsive maintenance and service should something go wrong. Meeting core obligations to stakeholders is primarily about delivering good products and services, but it is also about communicating and preparing for potential problems, whether from within the company or from external circumstances like a natural disaster.</p>

<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm360835248">We have seen that stakeholders include the people and entities invested in and influential in the success of an organization. It is also true that stakeholders can have multiple, and simultaneous, roles. For example, an employee can also be a customer and a stockholder.</p>
<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm362843376">Any transaction between a stakeholder and a business organization may appear finite. For instance, after you purchase something from a store you leave and go home. But your relationship with the store probably continues. You might want to repurchase the item or ask a question about a warranty. The store may have collected future marketing data about you and your purchases through its customer loyalty program or your use of a credit card.</p>
<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm338423408">Samsung, based in South Korea, is a large, multinational corporation that makes a variety of products, including household appliances such as washers and dryers. When Samsung&#8217;s washers developed a problem with the spin cycle in 2017, the company warned customers that the machines could become unbalanced and tip over, and that children should be kept away. The problem persisted, however, and Samsung&#8217;s responsibility and legal exposure increased. The eventual fix was to offer all owners of the particular washer model a full refund even if the customer did not have a complaint, and to offer free pick up of the machine as well. The recall covered almost three million washers, which ranged in price from $450 to $1500. By choosing to spend billions to rectify the problem, Samsung limited its legal exposure to potential lawsuits, settlement of which would likely have far exceeded the refunds it paid. This example demonstrates the weight of the implicit social contract between a company and its stakeholders and the potential impact on the bottom line if that contract is broken.</p>
<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm346542928">When a product does not live up to its maker&#8217;s claims for whatever reason, the manufacturer needs to correct the problem to retain or regain customers&#8217; trust. Without this trust, the interdependence between the company and its stakeholders can fail. By choosing to recognize and repay its customer stakeholders, Samsung acted at an <span data-type="term" id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_term66" group-by="e">ethical maximum</span>, taking the strongest possible action to behave ethically in a given situation. An <span data-type="term" id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_term67" group-by="e">ethical minimum</span>, or the least a company might do that complies with the law, would have been to offer the warning and nothing more. This may have been a defensible position in court, but the warning might not have reached all purchasers of the defective machine and many children could have been hurt.</p>
<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm365557104">Each case of a faulty product or poorly delivered service is different. If laws reach above a minimum standard, they can grow cumbersome and impede business growth. If businesses adhere only to laws and ethical minimums, however, they can develop poor reputations and people can be harmed. The ethically minimal course of action is not illegal or <em data-effect="italics">necessarily</em> unethical, but the company choosing it will have failed to recognize the value of its customers.</p>

These employees are called &#8220;pickers,&#8221; and their task is to fill an order and deliver it to the processing and packing center as quickly as possible. The design of the center is a trade secret that results in a random distribution of products. Therefore, the picker has to cover a number of directions and distances while filling an order. Those who cannot keep up the pace are usually let go, just as would be those who steal.</c:para>

They include such offerings as on-site exercise rooms and other services, company discounts, complimentary or subsidized snacks or meals, and the opportunity to buy stock in the company at a discounted price. Astute business leaders see the increased costs of amenities as an investment in retaining employees as long-term stakeholders. Stakeholder loyalty within and outside the firm is essential in sustaining any business venture, no matter how small or large.</p>

One view holds that businesses should behave ethically within the marketplace but concern themselves <em data-effect="italics">only</em> with serving shareholders and other investors. This view places economic considerations above all others. The other view is that stakeholders are not the means to the end (profit) but are ends in and of themselves as human beings (see our earlier discussion of deontological ethics in <a href="#193f2cff-9aaf-4529-a53f-a9d10bf9ae44">Ethics from Antiquity to the Present</a>).

<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm338325680">One challenge for any organization&#8217;s managers is that not all stakeholders agree on where the company should strive to land when it chooses between ethical minimums and maximums. Take stockholders, for example. Logically, most stockholders are interested in maximizing the return on their investment in the firm, which earns profit for them in the form of dividends. Lynn Stout, late Professor of Law at Cornell Law School, described the role of shareholder in this way:</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_66990">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm371761104"><q id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm364928064">&#8220;Shareholders as a class want companies to be able to treat their stakeholders well, because this encourages employee and customer loyalty . . . Yet individual shareholders can profit from pushing boards to exploit committed stakeholders&#8212;say, by threatening to outsource jobs unless employees agree to lower wages, or refusing to support products customers have come to rely on unless they buy expensive new products as well. In the long run, such corporate opportunism makes it difficult for companies to attract employee and customer loyalty in the first place.&#8221; <a data-type="cite" href="#auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_rf-002" id="c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e-endNote4"><sup class="os-end-note-number">4</sup></a></q></c:para>
<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm360229792">Essential to Stout&#8217;s point is that shareholders do not necessarily behave as a class. Some will want to maximize their investment even at a cost to other stakeholders. Some may want to extend beyond the legal minimum and seek a long-term perspective on profit maximization, demanding better treatment of stakeholders to maximize future potential value and to do more good than harm.</p>
<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm377468464">In the long run, stakeholder welfare must be kept at the heart of each company&#8217;s business operations for these significant, twin reasons: It is the right thing to do and it is good for business. Still, if managers need additional incentive to act on the basis of policies that benefit stakeholders, it is useful to recall that stakeholders who believe their interests have been ignored will readily make their displeasure known, both to company management and to the much wider community of social media.</p>

<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm199018672">By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>

<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm196094656">As we saw earlier in this chapter and in <a href="#282cabf7-18a2-4e8c-b46d-3cdd8e6bc5c8">Why Ethics Matter</a>, the law only partially captures the ethical obligations firms owe their <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_term70" group-by="s">stakeholder</span>s. A particular <span data-type="term" id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_term71" group-by="s">stakeholder claim</span>, that is, any given stakeholder&#8217;s interest in a business decision, may therefore challenge the ethical stance even of an organization that complies with the law. For example, some community members may oppose the opening of a &#8220;big box&#8221; chain store that threatens the livelihoods of small-business owners in the area, while shareholders, creditors, employees, and consumers within the nearby neighborhoods support it as an additional opportunity for profit and quality goods at competitive prices. Conflicts like this illustrate how complicated prioritizing stakeholder claims can be, particularly when there are ethical pros and cons on both sides. A big box store may offer a wider selection of goods at lower prices, for example, and create jobs for teens and part-time workers.</p>
<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm183697792">A related theme to recall is that even though all stakeholder claims are important for a company to acknowledge, not all claims are of equal importance. Most business leaders appreciate that a company&#8217;s key stakeholders are essential to its efficient operation and growth, and that its overall mission, goals, and limited resources will force its managers to make choices by prioritizing stakeholders&#8217; needs. In this section, we look at ethical ways in which business managers can begin to make those decisions.</p>

According to Donaldson and Preston, in the normative approach &#8220;the interests of all stakeholders are of intrinsic value.

At the lowest level is the descriptive approach, which merely sets the stage for consideration of stakeholder claims and concerns. The instrumental aspect combines a consideration for profit along with other stakeholder concerns and attempts to balance these interests with particular attention to the way the company and its shareholders might be affected. The normative approach takes the most comprehensive view of the organization and its stakeholders, putting the focus squarely on stakeholders. Although Donaldson and Preston stress that the descriptive and instrumental approaches are integral to stakeholder theory, they contend that the fundamental basis of stakeholder theory is normative.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_rf-003" id="0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2-endNote7"><sup class="os-end-note-number">7</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm184078976">A classic example of negative consumer reaction is the response that met Ford Motor Company&#8217;s 1958 introduction of the Edsel (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_OSX_Ethics_03_02_Edsel">Figure 3.3</a>). Ford had done extensive research to create a luxury family sedan aimed at an upper-income segment of the market then dominated by Buick, Oldsmobile, and Chrysler. However, the market did not identify Ford products with high status, and the Edsel did not last three years in the marketplace. Ford failed to serve the investors, suppliers, and employees who depended on the company for their livelihoods. Of course, the corporation survived that failure, perhaps because it learned the lessons of stakeholder management the hard way.</p>

<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm207665360">As the <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_OSX_Ethics_03_02_Grunig">Figure 3.4</a> shows, enabling and functional stakeholders are those active in design, production, and marketing. They provide input for the products or services the organization distributes in the form of output. Companies should identify <em data-effect="italics">all</em> the stakeholders shown in the figure and consider how they are linked to the firm. Although the diffused linkage stakeholders will vary according to place and time, the enabling, functional, and normative linkage stakeholders are constant, because they are integral to the operation of the firm. Stakeholders, in turn, can exert some control and authority by serving on the board of directors, by exercising their power as purchasers, by being elected to public office, or by joining employees&#8217; unions.</p>
<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm184052032">In many cases, if one stakeholder effects a change in the firm, other stakeholders will be affected. For example, if an NGO raises concerns about unequal pay of laborers on a rubber plantation that provides raw materials for gasket makers, the supplier may be forced to equalize pay, incurring additional expense. The supplier has taken the ethical action, but ultimately the cost is likely passed through the supply chain to the end user, the retail purchaser at the local car dealer. The supplier could also have absorbed the additional cost, diminishing the bottom line and reducing returns for stockholders, who may withdraw their investment from the company. Although this model of stakeholder relationships is complex, it is useful in understanding the impact of each individual group on the organization as a whole.</p>
<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm211253520">James E. Grunig, now professor emeritus at University of Maryland, and Todd Hunt, who together developed the organizational linkage model in <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_OSX_Ethics_03_02_Grunig">Figure 3.4</a>, looked at these relationships through the lens of four &#8220;publics&#8221; or cohorts: the nonpublic, the latent, the aware, and the active. These publics are distinguished by their degree of awareness of a problem and ability to do something about it. In the nonpublic cohort, no problem is recognized or exists. For the latent public, a problem is there but the public does not recognize it. The aware public recognizes that a problem exists. The active public is aware of the problem and organizes to respond to it. These categories help the organization design its message about a problem and decide how to communicate. Herein lies the ethical significance. If an organization is aware of a problem and the public is not, the organization has an opportunity to communicate and guide the public in recognizing and dealing with it, as the example of Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Tylenol product in the following box illustrates.</p>
<div class="real-world" data-type="note" id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm206172800"><h3 class="os-title" data-type="title"><span class="os-title-label">Cases from the Real World</span></h3><div class="os-note-body"><h4 data-type="title" id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_15851" class="os-subtitle"><span class="os-subtitle-label">The Chicago Tylenol Murders</span></h4><p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm228112624">In the fall of 1982, Johnson &amp; Johnson faced a public relations nightmare when customers in Cook County, Illinois, began dying&#8212;eventually, a total of seven people died&#8212;after taking over-the-counter, Tylenol-branded acetaminophen capsules. Analysis showed the presence of potassium cyanide, a fatal poison in no way connected with the production of the pill. Johnson &amp; Johnson voluntarily removed all Tylenol products from the U.S. marketplace and offered to pay full retail price for any pills returned to the company. This represented about thirty million bottles of capsules worth more than $100 million. (Significantly, too, Johnson &amp; Johnson decided on this wide-ranging action despite the fact that it and law enforcement realized the cyanide poisoning was limited to Cook County, Illinois.)</p>
<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm228366480">Because Tylenol was a flagship product bringing in significant revenue, this was an extreme action but one based on the company&#8217;s ethics, rooted in its corporate credo. Investigation showed that someone had tinkered with the bottles and injected cyanide into the product in stores. Although no one was ever apprehended, the entire drug industry responded, following Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s lead, by introducing tamper-proof containers that warned consumers not to use the product if the packaging appeared in any way compromised.</p>
<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm212367856">The strong ethical stance taken by Johnson &amp; Johnson executives resulted in immediate action that reassured the public. When the company eventually returned Tylenol to the market, it introduced it first to clinics, hospitals, and physicians&#8217; offices, promoting medicine&#8217;s professional trust in the product. The strategy was successful. Before the poisonings, Tylenol had 37 percent of the market of over-the-counter analgesics. That plunged to 7 percent in fall 1982 but was resurrected to 30 percent by fall 1983.</p>
<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm191381440"><strong data-effect="bold">Critical Thinking</strong></p>
<ul id="fs-idm233245152">
<li>In its corporate credo, Johnson &amp; Johnson identifies multiple stakeholders: users of its products (output), employees (input), employees&#8217; families (diffused linkage), and the government (enabling linkage). Applying Grunig and Hunt&#8217;s theory, do you believe Johnson &amp; Johnson acted as an enlightened company that includes and communicates with a variety of publics?</li>
<li>U.S. business leaders are often accused of acting on a short-term obsession with profitability at the expense of the long-term interests of their corporation. Which aspects of the Tylenol crisis demonstrate a short-term perspective? Which show the value of a longer-term perspective?</li>

If you have ever had a problem with a cable television or satellite company, you can immediately understand this stakeholder relationship, because it is so difficult to find someone with enough authority to make a decision on behalf of the company. Some companies count on individuals&#8217; growing frustrated and giving up on the claim. An indirect stakeholder claim might also be one that affects future generations, such as concerns about air and water pollution. For example, University of Southern California law professor Christopher D. Stone introduced in 1972 what was then a radical concept for the law in the United States, that the environment itself is entitled to legal standing in the courts. If this were so, then the environment might also be eligible for certain protections under the law. Appearing at the dawn of increasing social awareness of ecologic concerns, Stone&#8217;s influential law review article &#8220;Should Trees Have Standing?&#8221; gave many environmentalists a new legal philosophy to harness in defense of the natural world.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_rf-012" id="0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2-endNote16"><sup class="os-end-note-number">16</sup></a></c:para>

The first step in <span data-type="term" id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_term81" group-by="s">stakeholder management</span>, the process of accurately assessing stakeholder claims so an organization can manage them effectively, is therefore to define and prioritize stakeholders significant to the firm. Then, it must consider their claims.</p>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm354103472">Given that there are numerous types of stakeholders, how do managers balance these claims? Ethically, no group should be treated better than another, and managers should respond to as many stakeholders as possible. However, time and resource limitations require organizations to prioritize claims as stakeholder needs rise and fall.</p>

<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm336756736">First, it may help to speak to the expectations that any stakeholders may have of a particular business or institution. It depends on particular stakeholders, of course, but we can safely say that all stakeholders expect a form of satisfaction from an organization. If these stakeholders are shareholders (stockowners), then they generally wish to see a high return on their purchase of company shares. If, on the other hand, they are employees, they typically hope for interesting tasks, a safe work environment, job security, and rewarding pay and benefits. If, yet again, the stakeholders are members of the community surrounding a business, they usually wish that the company not harm the physical environment or degrade the quality of life within it.</p>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm346372800">So the task confronting an organization&#8217;s management begins with understanding these multiple and sometimes conflicting expectations and ethically deciding which stakeholders to focus on and in what sequence, if not all stakeholders cannot be addressed simultaneously, that is, <span data-type="term" id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_term82" group-by="s">stakeholder prioritization</span>. It helps to actively gather information about all key stakeholders and their claims. First, managers must establish that an individual with a concern is a member of a stakeholder group. For example, a brand may attract hundreds or thousands of mentions on Twitter each day. Which ones should be taken seriously as representative of key stakeholders? Brand managers look for patterns of communication and for context when deciding whether to engage with customers in the open expanses of social media platforms.</p>

<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm367489552">Read this <a href="https://openstax.org/l/53FiveQuestions">article &#8220;Five Questions to Identify Key Stakeholders&#8221;</a> in the <em data-effect="italics">Harvard Business Review</em> to learn more about identifying your key stakeholders.</p>
</div></div>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm365535984">After establishing that a key stakeholder group is being represented, the manager should identify what the company needs from the stakeholder. This simply helps clarify the relationship. If nothing is needed immediately or for the foreseeable future, this does not mean the stakeholder group does not matter, but it can be a good indication that the stakeholder need not be prioritized at the moment.</p>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm358519680">Note that managers are often considering these questions in real time, usually with limited resources and power, and that circumstances can change in a matter of moments. In one sense, all representatives of a company are constantly practicing stakeholder prioritization. It need not be a formal process. At times, it is a question of which supplier should be praised or prodded or which customer has a larger order to fill or a special request that might be met. What matters is establishing that someone is a stakeholder, that the concern is currently important, and that the relationship matters for the growth of the business.</p>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm371724800">If the firm cannot survive without this particular stakeholder or replace him or her relatively easily, then such a person should have priority over other stakeholders who do not meet this criterion. Key suppliers, lucrative or steady customers, and influential regulators must all be attended to but not necessarily capitulated to. For example, a local state legislator representing the district where a business is located may be urging the legislature to raise business taxes to generate more revenue for the state. By him- or herself, the legislator may not have sufficient political clout to persuade the legislature to raise taxes. Yet wise business leaders will not ignore such a representative and will engage in dialogue with him or her. The legislator may eventually be able to win others over to the cause, so it behooves perceptive management to establish a working relationship with him or her.</p>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm349600528">Not every stakeholder can command constant attention, and no firm has unlimited time or resources, so in one sense, this prioritizing is simply the business of management. Combine the inherent priority of the stakeholder relationship with the level of <span data-type="term" id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_term83" group-by="e">exigency</span>, that is, the level of urgency of a stakeholder claim, to arrive at a decision about where to begin focusing resources and efforts.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_63625">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm334048112">Stakeholder prioritization will also vary based on time and circumstance. For example, a large retailer facing aggressive new competitors must prioritize customer service and value. With Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and drastically cutting prices, the grocery chain&#8217;s customer base may very well grow because prices could become more attractive while the perception of high quality may persist. Potential customers may no longer need to economize by shopping elsewhere.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_rf-001" id="c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82-endNote17"><sup class="os-end-note-number">17</sup></a> Whole Foods&#8217; competitors, on the other hand, must now prioritize customer service, whereas before they could compete on price alone. Whole Foods can become a serious competitor to discount grocery stores like ALDI and Walmart.</c:para>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm340780560">Another way to prioritize stakeholder relationships is with a matrix of their power and interest. As <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_OSX_Ethics_03_03_Matrix">Figure 3.5</a> shows, a stakeholder group can be weighted on the basis of its influence (or power) over and interest in its relationship to the firm. A stakeholder with a high level of both power and interest is a key stakeholder. If this type of stakeholder group encounters a problem, its priority rises.</p>

<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm336073360">On the supplier side, a small farmer or seasonal supplier could fall in the low-power, low-interest category, particularly if that farmer were selling various retailers produce from his or her fields. However, if that same farmer could connect to a huge purveyor like Kroger, he or she could sell this giant customer its entire crop. This relationship places the farmer in the low-power, high-interest category, meaning he or she will most likely have to make price adjustments to make the sale.</p>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm372332080">The model&#8217;s focus on power reveals a need for any company to carefully cultivate relationships with stakeholders. Not all stakeholders have equal influence with a firm. Still, no organization can blithely ignore any stakeholder without potentially debilitating economic consequences. For example, now that Amazon has acquired Whole Foods and increased the size of the customer stakeholder group, it must also find ways to personalize its communications with this group, because personal service has traditionally been more a hallmark of Whole Foods than of Amazon.</p>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm348036720">Successful business practice today hinges on the ethical acknowledgement of stakeholder claims. It is the right thing to do. Not only that, it also engenders satisfied stakeholders, whether they be customers, stockowners, employees, or the community in which a firm is located. Naturally, satisfied stakeholders lead to the financial well-being of a company.</p>

To accomplish this, however, stakeholders must first be clearly identified and then periodically reidentified, because stakeholder cohorts change in size and significance over time. The concerns or claims of stakeholders are identified through data gathering and analysis. Sometimes a firm will conduct surveys or focus groups with customers, suppliers, or other stakeholders. Other times, product usage data will be available as a function of sales figures and marketing data. For software in web and mobile applications, for example, user data may be readily available to show how stakeholders are using the company&#8217;s digital services or why they appear to be purchasing its products. Another source of stakeholder data is social media, where firms can monitor topics stakeholders of all types are talking about. What matters is gathering relevant and accurate data and ensuring that key stakeholders are providing it. In the next step, managers present the results of their research to the company&#8217;s decision makers or make decisions themselves.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_rf-003" id="c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82-endNote19"><sup class="os-end-note-number">19</sup></a> Finally, stakeholders should be informed that their concerns were taken into consideration and that the company will continue to heed them.

<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm329336208">Because every firm, no matter its mission, ultimately depends on the marketplace, its clients or customers are often high-priority stakeholders. Ethically, the company owes allegiance to customer stakeholders, but it also has an opportunity and perhaps a responsibility to shape their expectations in ways that encourage its growth and allow it to continue to provide for employees, suppliers, distributors, and shareholders.</p>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm346383440">We should note, too, that nonprofit organizations are beholden, for the most part, to the same rules that apply to for-profits for their sustainability. Nonprofits typically provide a service that is just as dependent on cash flow as is the service or product of a for-profit. A significant difference, of course, is that the client or customer for a nonprofit&#8217;s service often is unable to pay for it. Therefore, the necessary cash must come from other sources, often in the form of donations or endowments. Hence, those who give to philanthropies constitute essential stakeholders for these nonprofits and must be acknowledged as such.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_29675">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm347226640">Wesley E. Lindahl, who studies and advises nonprofits, notes that philanthropies have an ethical obligation to safeguard the donations that come their way. He likens this to a stewardship, because the monies given to charities are gifts intended for others very much in need of them. So those who manage nonprofits have a special obligation to ensure that these donations are well spent and distributed appropriately.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_rf-005" id="c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82-endNote21"><sup class="os-end-note-number">21</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm349572016">There are three major components to bringing about change in customer or donor expectations: (1) customer receptivity to a product or service offered by the company, (2) acknowledgement of the gap between customer receptivity and corporate action to reduce it, and (3) a system to bring about and maintain change in customer desires to bring it in line with precisely what the corporation can deliver. One example of firms altering customers&#8217; habits is the evolution of beverage containers. Most soft drinks and other beverages such as beer were once delivered in reusable glass bottles. Customers were motivated to return the bottles by the refund of a minimal cash deposit originally paid at the time of purchase. The bottles had to be thick and sturdy for reuse, which resulted in substantial transportation costs, due to their weight.</p>
<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm336867328">To reduce these costs of manufacturing and transportation, manufacturers first redesigned production to be local, and then, when technology allowed, introduced aluminum cans and pull tabs. Eventually, the cardboard carton that held bottles together was replaced by a plastic set of rings to hold aluminum cans together. Now, however, customers and other stakeholders object to the hazard these rings present to wildlife. Some firms have responded by redesigning their packaging yet again. This ongoing process of developing new packaging, listening to feedback, and redesigning the product over time ultimately changed stakeholder behavior and modernized the beverage industry. Stakeholders are essential parts of a cycle of mutual interest and involvement.</p>

<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm373011600">The ethical responsibility of a stakeholder is to make known his or her preferences to the companies he or she purchases from or relies on. Such communication can lead to an increased commitment on the part of corporations to improve. To the extent they do so, companies act more ethically in responding to the wishes and needs of their stakeholders.</p>

<p id="auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_fs-idm205992432">Thus far, we have discussed stakeholders mostly as individuals and groups outside the organization. This section focuses on the business firm as a stakeholder in its environment and examines the concept of a corporation as a socially responsible entity conscious of the influences it has on society. That is, we look at the role companies, and large corporations in particular, play as active stakeholders in communities. Corporations, by their sheer size, affect their local, regional, national, and global communities. Creating a positive impact in these communities may mean providing jobs, strengthening economies, or driving innovation. Negative impacts may include doing damage to the environment, forcing the exit of smaller competitors, and offering poor customer service, to name a few. This section examines the concept of a corporation as a socially responsible entity conscious of the influences it has on society.</p>

<p id="auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_fs-idm632844048">In recent years, many organizations have embraced corporate social responsibility (CSR), a philosophy (introduced in <a href="#282cabf7-18a2-4e8c-b46d-3cdd8e6bc5c8">Why Ethics Matter</a>,) in which the company&#8217;s expected actions include not only producing a reliable product, charging a fair price with fair profit margins, and paying a fair wage to employees, but also caring for the environment and acting on other social concerns. Many corporations work on prosocial endeavors and share that information with their customers and the communities where they do business. CSR, when conducted in good faith, is beneficial to corporations and their stakeholders. This is especially true for stakeholders that have typically been given low priority and little voice, such as the natural environment and community members who live near corporate sites and manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p id="auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_fs-idm183776928">CSR in its ideal form focuses managers on demonstrating the social good of their new products and endeavors. It can be framed as a response to the backlash corporations face for a long track record of harming environments and communities in their efforts to be more efficient and profitable. Pushback is not new. Charles Dickens wrote about the effects of the coal economy on nineteenth-century England and shaped the way we think about the early industrial revolution. The twentieth-century writer Chinua Achebe, among many others, wrote about colonization and its transformative and often painful effect on African cultures. Rachel Carson first brought public attention to corporation&#8217;s chemical poisoning of U.S. waterways in her 1962 book <em data-effect="italics">Silent Spring</em>.</p>
<p id="auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_fs-idm199018672">Betty Friedan&#8217;s <em data-effect="italics">The Feminine Mystique</em> (1963) critiqued the way twentieth-century industrialization boxed women into traditional roles and limited their agency. Kate Chopin&#8217;s novel <em data-effect="italics">The Awakening</em> (1899) and the nineteenth-century novels of Jane Austen had already outlined how limited options were for women despite massive social and economic shifts in the industrializing West. Stakeholder communities left out of or directly harmed by the economic revolution have demanded that they be able to influence corporate and governmental economic practices to benefit more directly from corporate growth as well as entrepreneurship opportunities. The trend to adopt CSR may represent an opportunity for greater engagement and involvement by groups mostly ignored until now by the wave of corporate economic growth reshaping the industrialized world.</p>

Destruction of the environment can ultimately lead to reduction of resources, declining business opportunities, and lowered quality of life. Enlightened business stakeholders realize that profit is only one positive effect of business operations. In addition to safeguarding the environment, other ethical contributions that stakeholders could lobby corporate management to make include establishing schools and health clinics in impoverished neighborhoods and endowing worthwhile philanthropies in the communities where companies have a presence.</c:para>

For example, the state of California in 2015 enacted a set of laws, referred to as the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, which requires firms to report on the working conditions of the employees of their suppliers. The law requires only disclosures, but the added transparency is a step toward holding U.S. and other multinational corporations responsible for what goes on before their products appear in shiny packages in stores. The legislators who wrote California&#8217;s Supply Chains Act recognize that consumer stakeholders are likely to bring pressure to bear on companies found to use slave labor in their supply chains, so forcing disclosure can bring about change because corporations would rather adjust their relationships with supply-chain stakeholders than risk alienating massive numbers of customers.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_rf-003" id="2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f-endNote26"><sup class="os-end-note-number">26</sup></a></c:para>

Firms need customers. Customers need employment, and the state needs taxes just as firms need resources. All stakeholders exist in an interdependent network of relationships, and what is most needed is a sustainable system that enables all types of key stakeholders to establish and apply influence.</p>

<p id="auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_fs-idm202101104">How can corporations and their stakeholders measure some of the effects of CSR programs? The <span data-type="term" id="auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_term86" group-by="t">triple bottom line (TBL)</span> offers a way. TBL is a measure described in 1994 by John Elkington, a British business consultant (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_OSX_Ethics_03_04_Triple">Figure 3.6</a>), and it forces us to reconsider the very concept of the &#8220;bottom line.&#8221; Most businesses, and most consumers for that matter, think of the bottom line as a shorthand expression of their financial well-being. Are they making a profit, staying solvent, or falling into debt? That is the customary bottom line, but Elkington suggests that businesses need to consider not just one but rather three measures of their <em data-effect="italics">true</em> bottom line: the economic and also the social and environmental results of their actions. The social and environmental impacts of doing business, called people and planet in the TBL, are the <em data-effect="italics">externalities</em> of their operations that companies must take into account.</p>

<p id="auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_fs-idm194123744">The TBL concept recognizes that external stakeholders consider it a corporation&#8217;s responsibility to go beyond making money. If increasing wealth damages the environment or makes people sick, society demands that the corporation revise its methods or leave the community. Society, businesses, and governments have realized that all stakeholders have to work for the common good. When they are successful at acting in a socially responsible way, corporations will and should claim credit. In acting according to the TBL model and promoting such acts, many corporations have reinvested their efforts and their profits in ways that can ultimately lead to the development of a sustainable economic system.</p>

By positioning themselves as stakeholders in a broader global community, conscientious corporations can be exemplary organizations. They can demonstrate interest and influence on a global scale and improve the way the manufacture of goods and delivery of services serve the local and global environment. They can return to communities as much as they extract and foster automatic financial reinvestment so that people willing and able to work for them can afford not only the necessities but a chance to pursue happiness.</p>
<p id="auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_fs-idm209424704">In return, global corporations will have sustainable business models that look beyond short-term growth forecasts. They will have a method of operating and a framework for thinking about sustained growth with stakeholders and <em data-effect="italics">as</em> stakeholders. Ethical stakeholder relationships systematically grow wealth and opportunity in dynamic fashion. Without them, the global consumer economy may fail. On an alternate and ethical path of prosperity, today&#8217;s supplier is a consumer in the next generation and Earth is still inhabitable after many generations of dynamic change and continued global growth.</p>

<p id="auto_c5bd1700-c799-4fc1-b7f3-8056b941712e_fs-idm363144288">An organization has duties and responsibilities with regard to each stakeholder; however, the implicit social contract between business and society means that meeting legal requirements might support only minimal ethical standards. Society on the whole and in the long run requires that business consider a broader range of duties in its relationships with key stakeholders.</p>

<p id="auto_0454a731-4740-479d-95b2-e896bcc354f2_fs-idm205948032">There are three approaches to stakeholder theory: the descriptive approach, the instrumental approach, and the normative approach. The normative approach takes the most comprehensive view of the organization and its stakeholders and is the fundamental basis of stakeholder theory. Organizations can analyze stakeholder claims by classifying them on the basis of their intensity and impact on the firm, as well as on the basis of their relationship to the firm. Such classifications may include enabling stakeholders, normative stakeholders, functional stakeholders, and diffused stakeholders. Using the lens of the four &#8220;publics&#8221; (the nonpublic, the latent, the aware, and the active), we can also understand a stakeholder claim on the basis of the public&#8217;s degree of awareness of a problem and ability to do something about it.</p>

<p id="auto_c3bdfb61-ab6a-469c-a8dd-39ae59edef82_fs-idm331664016">Business leaders prioritize those stakeholders who have immediate needs or high urgency or great significance to the organization, and the identity of these groups may shift over time. Stakeholders can also be prioritized on the basis of their relationship to the organization using a matrix of their power and interest. Steps in the MITRE stakeholder management process are to establish trust, identify stakeholders, gather and analyze appropriate data, present information to management, and let stakeholders know they matter. Because customers are often considered high-priority stakeholders, it can be essential for corporations and nonprofit organizations to manage any expectations that customers (or donors) may have.</p>

<p id="auto_2857fa52-8190-432d-b2f7-f2fee9ca482f_fs-idm197838624">Most organizations must practice genuine corporate social responsibility to be successful in the modern marketplace. The triple bottom line places people and the planet on equal standing with profit in the mission of an organization. The genuine practice of CSR, unlike greenwashing, requires a commitment to an additional stakeholder, the planet, whose continued healthy existence is essential for any organization to operate.</p>

<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm192158448">Corporate law, which enables businesses to take advantage of a legal structure that separates liability from ownership and control, was introduced in most states in the nineteenth century. The separation of ownership and liability means that, unlike sole proprietors and members of partnerships, owners of modern business corporations enjoy the advantage of limited liability for the corporation&#8217;s debts and other financial obligations, a concept at the heart of a U.S. economic system built on capitalism.</p>

<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm208121408">Without state incorporation laws, business owners would be subject to personal liability for business losses, which could create several disadvantages. Ownership would be riskier, so owners could have more difficulty selling their ownership interests. They could also be subject to a pro rata share of income taxes. These types of personal financial liability could limit the ability of businesses to raise capital by selling stock. Limited liability, by reducing the amount a shareholder can lose from investing in a corporation by buying its stock, increases the investment&#8217;s attractiveness to potential new shareholders. Ultimately, corporate status increases both the potential number of willing investors and the amount of capital they are likely to invest. After all, would you be willing to invest your money in a business if you knew not only that you could lose the capital you invested, but also that you could be sued personally for any and all debts of the business?</p>
<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm187628256">Corporate status is conferred upon a business by state law (statute) when a state issues the business a charter of incorporation. The protective shield of <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_term90" group-by="c">corporate status</span> enables businesses to socialize their losses in a way that traditional proprietorships and partnerships are not able to do. <em data-effect="italics">Socializing</em> a loss is a means to amortize it or spread it out over society in general, so the owners do not absorb it individually. Amortization is similar to the idea behind insurance, in which many people bear a small share in a loss, rather than one or a few people bearing all of it. Therefore, it is accurate to say that society enables corporations to exist, both by passing laws that create them and by limiting the financial risk exposure of their owners. Since our society grants for-profit businesses the right to incorporate and make unlimited profits with limited liability, a reasonable person could conclude that corporations owe a debt to society in return.

<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm211063440">A longstanding ethical debate about corporate social responsibility asks whether, in fact, a corporation owes a duty to society or only to its shareholders. The line of important court cases shaping this issue spans almost a century and includes a series of landmark cases involving the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_term93" group-by="F">Ford Motor Company</span>, the Wrigley Company, and Hobby Lobby.</p>

Ford had announced that his company would stop paying big dividends to shareholders and instead would use its profits to achieve several other goals, including improving product quality, expanding company facilities, and perhaps most surprisingly, lowering prices. Shareholders then sued Ford, asking the court to order Ford Motor Company to continue allocating the lion&#8217;s share of profits to high dividend payments.

This was a unique position for the founder and primary owner of a large corporation to take in the early twentieth century. During the rise of capitalism in the United States, most owners sought only to maximize profits, because that was the primary basis of their ability to attract capital and to reinvest in the company. Most investors were interested in a healthy return on their investment, rather than any type of social good. Shareholders contended that the concern Ford expressed for his workers and customers was both improper and illegal. The court agreed, and Ford was forced to abandon his managerial goal of balancing profits and realizing broader social goals.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_rf-003" id="6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb-endNote3"><sup class="os-end-note-number">3</sup></a></c:para>

In the majority decision, Alito wrote, &#8220;A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends. When rights, whether constitutional or statutory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_rf-009" id="6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb-endNote9"><sup class="os-end-note-number">9</sup></a> Hobby Lobby is primarily owned by one family, and Alito&#8217;s comments seem to suggest that another interpretation would limit the applicability of the case to only closely held corporations, in which the majority of the stock is owned by a small number of shareholders.</c:para>
<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm210825040">Some might think Henry Ford&#8217;s attempt to forego profits in order to pay workers higher wages was a good choice but not find Hobby Lobby&#8217;s preference for limiting female employees&#8217; health insurance benefits on religious grounds to be so. However, the law must be interpreted logically: If you give management the prerogative to put one social issue ahead of profits, should management not also be able to pursue any social issue of its choosing? An extension of the logic used in the Hobby Lobby case could lead to an expansion of the corporate rights of the personhood doctrine, for example, by allowing the individual right to privacy to become a shield against regulatory scrutiny by government agencies (although a corporation is not a natural person).</p>
<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm207995168">Another potential problem with giving management greater rights to pursue social agendas is protecting the interests of minority shareholders who disagree with the majority. Since corporation law is state law, the protections for minority shareholders vary widely, but owners of a small number of shares have little or no power to influence the choices the corporation makes. Some states allow cumulative voting for seats on the board of directors, which increases minority shareholder power. Others permit buyouts or dissolution statutes that apply to closely held corporations. However, in a traditional large corporation, none of these protections for minority interests are likely to apply. Of course, another option is for disgruntled shareholders to sell their shares.</p>

<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm216376064">The issue of <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_term101" group-by="c">corporate social responsibility</span> is the subject of high-level global discussion and debate among leaders in the public and private sectors, such as the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Numerous respected academic centers also hold forums on CSR, such as the Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law at Stanford University and the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation.</p>
<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm211860112">As we have seen, slow but steady acceptance of CSR as a legitimate business concept has led to the legal and ethical position that corporate directors and managers may exercise business judgment and discretion in running a corporation. This development has come about for multiple reasons: a) the fact that society allows LLCs to exist, b) the sheer magnitude of the economic power corporations possess, and c) the desire of corporations to act responsibly in order to avoid more extensive government regulation. Managers are usually accorded significant latitude as long as they can point to a rational interpretation of their actions as benefiting the corporation as a whole in the long term. The combination of economic and political power in the world&#8217;s largest corporations necessitates that executives consider the interests of a broader set of stakeholders, rather than only stockholders. Indeed, social, environmental, and charitable programs often create shareholder value rather than take away from it. And honoring obligations to all stakeholders in a corporation&#8212;including those who own no stock shares&#8212;is the <span data-type="term" id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_term102" group-by="m">moral minimum</span> a firm must undertake to satisfy the base threshold for acting ethically.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_70781">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm207993424">A recent study by researchers at Princeton and the University of Texas indicates that corporations benefit from following CSR policies in multiple ways.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_rf-010" id="6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb-endNote10"><sup class="os-end-note-number">10</sup></a> These benefits are collectively called a &#8220;halo effect&#8221; and can add value to the business. As an example, consumers frequently take CSR spending as an indirect indicator that a company&#8217;s products are of high quality, and often they are also more willing to buy these products as an indirect way of donating to a good cause.</c:para>

He argued that both government regulation and corporate social initiatives allow an outside third party to make these choices for shareholders.</c:para>
<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm211155744">In Friedman&#8217;s opinion, too much power assumed by corporate management in pursuing a social agenda might ultimately lead to a form of corporate autocracy. Supporters of the profit maximization principle believe it is a waste of corporate resources to reduce air pollution below the level required by law, to require vendors to participate in a sustainable supply chain initiative, or to pay lower-level employees a salary above the legally mandated minimum wage. Friedman asserted that &#8220;doing good deeds&#8221; is not the job of corporations; it is the right of those people who want to do them but should not be imposed on those who do not. His philosophy asserts that socially oriented initiatives are analogous to a form of outside regulation, resulting in higher costs to those corporations that follow socially responsible policies.</p>
<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm205639904">When Friedman was laying out this position in the 1970s, it reflected the prevailing opinion of a majority of U.S. shareholders and commentators on corporate law at that time. In the years since then, however, Friedman&#8217;s perspective has fallen into disfavor. This does not invalidate his point of view, but it does demonstrate that public opinion about corporations is subject to change over time. The subjectivity or relativity with which we view companies along with their perceived rights and responsibilities is a major theme this text addresses.</p>

Some examples of relationships that include a fiduciary duty are those between a trustee of an estate and its beneficiary, and between a fund manager and a client. According to the American Bar Association, the business judgment rule states &#8220;that as fiduciaries, corporate directors owe the corporation and its shareholders fiduciary duties of diligence and fidelity in performing their corporate duties. These fiduciary obligations include the duty of care and the duty of loyalty . . . the duty of care consists of an obligation to act on an informed basis; the duty of loyalty requires the board and its directors to maintain, in good faith, the corporation&#8217;s and its shareholders&#8217; best interests over anyone else&#8217;s interests.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_rf-012" id="6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb-endNote12"><sup class="os-end-note-number">12</sup></a> So it would seem that the answer is yes, corporate directors do have a specific fiduciary duty to promote the best interests of the corporation. But what exactly does that duty entail? Does that specifically mean returning profits to shareholders in the form of dividends? As we have seen, these questions have frequently spilled over into the courts, in the form of shareholder lawsuits challenging the actions of directors and/or management.</c:para>

The fact that we have seen inconsistent decisions from the courts over the last century confirms the lack of legal consensus. Of course, both legal and ethical opinion are always in flux, so where the debate stands today in no way indicates where it will be in ten years. On this issue, public opinion, as well as that of politicians and even the courts, is like a pendulum swinging back and forth, usually between points of view that are center-right or center-left, rather than at the extremes. However, the pendulum is reset every so often, and the arc within which it swings may differ from era to era.</p>

Unilever&#8217;s subsidiary in India, Hindustan Lever, has started training programs for thousands of women in small towns and villages across India to help them understand how to run their own small sole proprietorships as distributors of the company&#8217;s products. With support from a team of rural sales managers, women who had been unable to support themselves are now becoming empowered by learning how a supply chain works, what products Hindustan Lever produces, and how to distribute them.

In 1992, Cormac Cullinan&#8217;s <em data-effect="italics">Wild Law</em> proposed &#8220;earth justice&#8221; or &#8220;earth jurisprudence,&#8221; a concept underlying the law&#8217;s ability to protect the environment and effectively regulate businesses that pollute. The preoccupation with business success through investment in corporations, in contrast, is a much older concept, dating back at least to the creation of the British East India Company in 1600, and the widespread emergence of the corporation in Europe in the 1700s. If you were a business owner, would you be willing to spend company resources on environmental issues, even if not required to do so by law? If so, would you be able to justify your actions to shareholders and investment analysts as smart business decisions?</p>

<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm245727040">The generally accepted constitutional basis for allowing corporations to assert that they have rights similar to those of a natural person is that they are organizations of people who should not be deprived of their rights simply because they act collectively. Thus, treating corporations as persons who have legal rights allows them to enter into contracts with other parties and to sue and be sued in a court of law, along with numerous other legal rights. Before and after the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling in <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_term111" group-by="C"><em data-effect="italics">Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em></span> (2010), which upheld the First Amendment free-speech rights of corporations, there have been numerous challenges to the concept of corporate personhood; however, none have been successful. Thus, U.S. law considers corporations to be persons with rights protected under key constitutional amendments, regulations, and case law, as well as responsibilities under the law, just as human persons have.</p>
<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm251458432">A question that logically springs from judicial interpretations of corporate personhood is whether the environment should enjoy similar legal status. Should the environment be considered the legal equivalent of a person, able to sue a business that pollutes it?

Advocates of earth jurisprudence assert that there is legal precedent for this position. As pointed out earlier in this chapter, it is not only natural persons who have legal rights, but also corporations, which are artificial entities. Our legal system also recognizes the rights of animals and has for several decades. According to earth jurisprudence advocates, officially recognizing the legal status of the environment is necessary to preserving a healthy planet for future generations, in particular because of the problem of &#8220;invisible pollution.&#8221;</p>

Cullinan, Berry, and others have written extensively about the important legal tenets of earth jurisprudence; however, it is not a legal doctrine officially adopted by the United States or any of its states to date. The concept of earth justice is tied indirectly to the economic theory of the &#8220;tragedy of the commons,&#8221; a phrase derived from British economist William Forster Lloyd, who, in the mid-nineteenth century, used a hypothetical example of unregulated grazing on common land to explain the human tendency to act independently, putting self-interest first, without regard for the common good of all users. The theory was later popularized by ecologist and philosopher Garrett Hardin, who tied it directly to environmental issues. In other words, when it comes to natural resources, the <span data-type="term" id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_term113" group-by="t">tragedy of the commons</span> holds that people generally use as much of a free resource as they want, without regard for the needs of others or for the long-term environmental effects.

In addition, some form of fee may be collected for using up a natural resource, such as severance taxes imposed on the removal of nonrenewable resources like oil and gas, or deposits required for possible cleanup costs after projects have been abandoned. As part of the growing acceptance of the concept of earth justice, several nonprofit educational organizations and NGOs have become active in both lobbying and environmental litigation. One such organization is the Center for Earth Jurisprudence (housed at the Barry School of Law in Orlando), a nonprofit group that conducts research in this area.</p>

<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm261352912">The notion that the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_term114" group-by="e">environment</span> should be treated as a person is relatively new. But given the prominence of the environmental movement worldwide, no well-managed business today should be conducted without an awareness of the tenuous balance between the health of the environment and corporate profits. It is quite simply good business practice for executives to be aware that their enterprise&#8217;s long-term sustainability, and indeed its profitability, depend greatly on their safeguarding the natural environment. Ignoring this interrelationship between business and the environment not only elicits public condemnation and the attention of lawmakers who listen to their constituents, but it also risks destroying the viability of the companies themselves. Virtually all businesses depend on natural resources in one way or another.</p>
<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm247850928">Progressive corporate managers recognize the multifaceted nature of <span data-type="term" id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_term115" group-by="s">sustainability</span>&#8212;a long-term approach to business activity, environmental responsibility, and societal impact. Sustainability affects not only the environment but also other stakeholders, including employees, the community, politics, law, science, and philosophy. A successful sustainability program thus requires the commitment of every part of the company. For example, engineers are designing manufacturing and production processes to meet the demands of companies dedicated to sustainability, and the idea of company-wide sustainability is now mainstream. Many of the largest companies in the world see sustainability as an important part of their future survivability.</p>

Siemens is a multinational industrial conglomerate headquartered in Germany, whose businesses range from power plants to electrical systems and equipment in the medical field and high-tech electronics. Siemens was rated the most energy-efficient firm in its sector, because it produced more dollars in revenue per kilowatt used than any other industrial corporation. This is a standard technique to judge efficiency and demonstrates that Siemens has a low carbon footprint for a company in the industries in which it operates. The commitment of Siemens to sustainability is further demonstrated by its decision to manufacture and sell more environmentally friendly infrastructure products such as green heating and air conditioning systems.</p>

Do businesses simply pay lip service to environmental issues while using all available natural resources to make as much money as they can in the present, or are they really committed to sustainability? There is abundant evidence that sustainability has become a policy adopted by businesses for financial reasons, not simply public relations.</p>

More than twenty thousand ISO standards now cover matters such as sustainability, manufactured products, technology, food, agriculture, and even healthcare.

The most famous example is the Empire State Building in New York City, which was awarded LEED Gold status (for existing buildings). The LEED certification was the result of a multimillion-dollar rebuilding program to bring the building up to date, and the building is the tallest in the United States to receive it. There are dozens of other examples of large commercial buildings, such as the Wells Fargo Tower in Los Angeles, as well as thousands of smaller buildings and residential homes.

<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm251210336">Sustainability often requires the public and private sectors to cooperate. Inaction contributes to disasters like the 2017 devastation of Houston by Hurricane Harvey and of Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria. There is often tension between developers who want to build and cities that try to legislate for more green space. Green space not only offers a place for recreation and enjoyment of nature, but also provides essential natural drainage for rain and flood waters, reducing the likelihood that developed areas will end up underwater in a storm.</p>

Imagine you are a member of the urban planning commission for the city council of Houston, which recently suffered traumatic flood damage from several major storms, including Hurricanes Harvey and Ike, and Tropical Storm Allison, all of which occurred since 2001 and caused a total of approximately $75 billion in damages.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_rf-039" id="510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea-endNote40"><sup class="os-end-note-number">40</sup></a> The floods also caused dozens of deaths and changed the lives of millions who lived through them.

<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm265144784">One of the most direct solutions is a seemingly simple tradeoff: The greater Houston area must reduce the percentage of land covered by concrete while increasing the percentage of land dedicated to green space, which acts like a sponge to absorb flood waters before they can do severe damage. The planning commission thinks the best way to accomplish this is to issue a municipal ordinance requiring corporate developers and builders to set aside as green space an amount of land at least equal to what will be covered by concrete, (neighborhoods, office buildings, parking lots, shopping centers). However, this will increase the cost of development, because it means more land will be required for each type of project, and as a result, developers will have higher land costs.</p>

<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm271550288">Some politicians and business leaders in the United States believe that the U.S. system of capitalism and free enterprise is the main reason for the nation&#8217;s prosperity over the past two hundred years and the key to its future success. Free enterprise was very effective in facilitating the economic development of the United States, and many people benefited from it. But it is equally true that this could not have happened without the country&#8217;s wealth of natural resources like oil, gas, timber, water, and many others. When we consider the environment and the role of sustainability, the question is not whether our system works well with an abundance of natural resources. Rather, we should ask how well it would work in a nation, indeed in a world, in which such resources were severely limited.</p>

The <em data-effect="italics">Harvard Business Review</em> recently conducted a debate on this topic on its opinion/editorial pages. Business owes the world everything and nothing, according to Andrew Winston, author and consultant on environmental and social challenges. &#8220;It&#8217;s an important question,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;but one that implies business should do the socially responsible thing out of a sense of duty. This idea is a distraction. Sustainability in business is not about philanthropy, but about profitability, innovation, and growth. It&#8217;s just plain good business.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_rf-043" id="510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea-endNote44"><sup class="os-end-note-number">44</sup></a> On the other hand, Bart Victor, professor at Vanderbilt University&#8217;s Owen Graduate School of Management, wrote, &#8220;Business is far more powerful and deeply influential than any competing ideological force, political force or environmental force . . . business now has to see itself and its responsibilities and obligations in a new way.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_rf-044" id="510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea-endNote45"><sup class="os-end-note-number">45</sup></a></c:para>

A basic moral imperative in a normative system of ethics is that someone who uses something must pay for it. In contrast, a more utilitarian philosophy might hold that corporations create jobs, make money for shareholders, pay taxes, and produce things that people want; thus, they have done their part and do not owe any other debt to the environment or society at large. However, utilitarianism is often regarded as a &#8220;here and now&#8221; philosophy, whereas deontology offers a longer-term approach, taking future generations into account and thus aligning more with <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_term124" group-by="s">sustainability</span>.</p>
<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm267152416">Should businesses have to pay more in fees or taxes than ordinary citizens for public resources or infrastructure they use to make a profit? Consider the example of fracking: West Texas has seen a recent boom in oil and gas drilling due to this relatively new process. Fracking is short for hydraulic fracturing, which creates cracks in rocks beneath Earth&#8217;s surface to loosen oil and gas trapped there, thus allowing it to flow more easily to the surface. Fracking has led to a greatly expanded effort to drill horizontally for oil and gas in the United States, especially in formations previously thought to be unprofitable, because there was no feasible way to get the fossil fuels to the surface. However, it comes with a significant downside.</p>
<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm272008208">Fracking requires very heavy equipment and an enormous amount of sand, chemicals, and water, most of which must be trucked in. Traffic around Texas&#8217;s small towns has increased to ten times the normal amount, buckling the roads under the pressure of a never-ending stream of oil company trucks. The towns do not have the budget to repair them, and residents end up driving on dangerous roads full of potholes. The oil company trucks are using a public resource, the local road system, often built with a combination of state and local taxpayer funds. They are obviously responsible for more of the damage than local residents driving four-door sedans to work. Shouldn&#8217;t the businesses have to pay a special levy to repair the roads? Many think it is unfair for small towns to have to burden their taxpayers, most of whom are not receiving any of the profits from oil and gas development, with the cost of road repair. An alternative might be to impose a Pigovian tax, which is a fee assessed against private businesses for engaging in a specific activity (proposed by British economist A. C. Pigou). If set at the proper level, the tax is intended as a deterrent to activities that impose a net cost&#8212;what economists call &#8220;negative externalities&#8221;&#8212;on third parties such as local residents.</p>
<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm269329776">This issue highlights one of many environmental debates sparked by the fracking process. Fracking also causes the overuse and pollution of fresh water, spills toxic chemicals into the ground water, and increases the potential for earthquakes due to the injection wells drilled for chemical disposal. Ultimately, as is often the case with issues stemming from natural resource extraction, local residents may receive a few short-term benefits from business activity related to drilling, but they end up suffering a disproportionate share of the long-term harm.</p>

While it reduces the driver&#8217;s carbon footprint, it requires charging every 250 miles, making long-distance travel a challenge until a national system of charging stations is in place.</p>
<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm267404000">Tesla&#8217;s founder, Elon Musk, is also the founder of SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer that produces and launches the only space-capable rockets currently in existence in the United States. Thus, when NASA wants to launch a rocket, it must do so in partnership with SpaceX, a private company. It is often the case that private companies develop important advances in technology, with incentives from government such as tax credits, low-interest loans, or subsidies. This is the reality of capital-intensive, high-tech projects in a free-market economy, in which government spending may be limited for budgetary and political reasons. Not only is SpaceX making the rockets, but it is making them reusable, with long-term sustainability in mind.</p>

In turn, about half the states also allow major cities to have their own air quality regulatory programs. &#8220;Think globally, act locally&#8221; seems to capture the essence of government regulation in air quality.

Some businesses are acting on their own to rein in the sale or use of harmful products.

<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm405821888">While private companies may take the initiative in response to public demand, and intergovernmental cooperation can accomplish many good things, sometimes the solution is for a private-sector company or industry to work directly with the government, as we saw with the example of Space X. Given the pressure on federal, state, and local agencies to reduce their budgets, many have increasingly turned to public-private partnerships, or P3s, as a means to solve problems.</p>
<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm404410816">Sometimes, however, the relationship between business and government can become too close, as when executives from the private sector leave their jobs to work for government agencies, becoming the regulators rather than the regulated, and then return to industry in a kind of &#8220;revolving door&#8221; effect. For example, Goldman Sachs, one of the world&#8217;s largest financial services firms, has seen many of its executives take senior leadership positions in the presidential administrations of both Democrats and Republicans, including the present secretary of the treasury, Steven Mnuchin. The same trend is occurring on a global level; Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, was previously a vice chair and managing director of Goldman Sachs International, and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, worked for Goldman Sachs as well. The large number of executives from one of the biggest investment banks in the world moving in and out of government service causes some critics to warn of the &#8220;fox guarding the hen house&#8221; approach to regulation. Is the relationship between government and the private sector sometimes too cozy? Does this revolving door in fact result in bad policy?</p>
<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm377857072">Of course, it would be incorrect to assume, because multiple executives of a firm landed in government positions, that the firm is automatically guilty of wrongdoing. Goldman Sachs has created several programs with ethical goals. The company encourages clients to consider environmental and sustainability issues, and it backs green bonds, which are used to fund projects that have positive environmental and/or climate benefits. In truth, our government would find it difficult to function without the expertise from the private sector supplementing that of the public sector in public service positions.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm400728720"><h3 data-type="title">Government Regulation and the Constitution</h3>
<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm384809504">Over the past decade, many politicians have run for office on a platform of reducing government regulation. There are at least two closely related positions on reducing federal government regulation. The first is essentially a <span data-type="term" id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_term131" group-by="s">states&#8217; rights</span> position that seeks to limit the powers of the federal government to those very specifically enumerated in the Constitution. It is based on principles embodied in the Tenth Amendment and on a narrow interpretation of the Commerce Clause. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states any right not specifically delegated to the federal government. The <span data-type="term" id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_term132" group-by="C">Commerce Clause</span> is the part of the Constitution that gives the federal government the right to regulate commerce between states.</p>
<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm397768320">The second, related view of government regulation holds that &#8220;less is better&#8221; at all levels, whether state or federal. Its followers simply seek to reduce the size of government and regulation at every level. Some might attribute this position to a libertarian or &#8220;small government&#8221; philosophy.</p>
<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm403121584">These two philosophies might be characterized as less government regulation vs. no government regulation, other than military defense. The preference for state regulation is often based on a belief in the business community that many states are softer on regulation that the federal government, or that states are closer to the problems businesses face and are more efficient at addressing them. However, there is little clear evidence that one branch of government is more efficient than another. The real challenge is weighing the benefits of regulation against the costs, and finding the right balance between over- and under-regulation. Weak regulation can allow a business to cut corners. For instance, auto emission regulations intended to go into effect by certain dates have been delayed multiple times during the 1980s and the early 2000s. The Obama administration announced plans to enforce tougher rules, but the current administration has said it plans to delay implementation. Auto emission regulations have become politically charged, constantly changing depending on the party in power, and some states have responded with their own legislation instead of waiting for the federal stalemate to end. Regulation that is consistently enforced in the effort to achieve the long-term goal, such as cleaner air, is preferable to a moving target.</p>
<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm400862080">A third position is that government is not necessarily a bad thing. Such a &#8220;federalist&#8221; philosophy might assert that centralized government provides an array of benefits for citizens. For example, in the <em data-effect="italics">Federalist Papers</em>, Alexander Hamilton emphasized that a well-intentioned central government was not the enemy of liberty but rather the best means of securing the rights achieved through the passage of the Constitution. He and others also pointed out an advantage of federal over state government&#8212;a large republic such as the United States would actually benefit from a larger electorate and a larger pool of qualified leaders, and competing state and regional interests would be more balanced under federal regulation.</p>
<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm399469776">Acceptance of one or the other of these philosophies may lean an administration towards more or less regulation, as well as calibrating its response to aggressive lobbying by industries seeking to reduce regulation they view as burdensome. The results for the environment and/or public health can sometimes be disastrous.</p>

Transocean, the rig owner/operator, did not install a relatively inexpensive safety device, an acoustically triggered shutoff valve, which most experts agree could have stopped the flow of oil from the well into the Gulf. Congress had not mandated such a device, largely as a result of oil industry lobbying, and since it wasn&#8217;t required, BP and Transocean were free to act as they pleased.</p>

Business entities may now seek to persuade the voting public by spending an unlimited amount of money on political ads, whether through social media or traditional print and broadcast media. Businesses opposed to government regulation can spend without limit to help elect candidates whose position on reduced regulation is the same as theirs, thereby increasing the pressure on Congress to deregulate.

<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm401721024">One of the sponsors of the corporate governance law known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), is among those who would like to see financial limits on business lobbying groups and political action committees, several of which are attempting to repeal current regulations such as SOX, which is tough on business fraud. <span data-type="term" id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_term135" group-by="S">Sarbanes-Oxley</span>, passed in 2002 in response to several highly publicized corporate fraud cases that took down companies such as Enron and WorldCom, mandates reporting transparency in areas ranging from finance to accounting to supply chain activities. Essentially, it ensures that we now consider it both unethical <em data-effect="italics">and</em> illegal to deceive shareholders, creditors, and the public at large.</p>
<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm401401424">Sarbanes-Oxley applies to publicly traded companies and is enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It covers multiple topics such as the independence of corporate boards and outside certified public accounting firms that audit corporations. The law also makes the CEO and CFO personally responsible for errors in annual audits&#8212;thus making it harder to &#8220;cook the books.&#8221; Finally, it prohibits company loans to executives and grants protection to whistleblowers.</p>
<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm384852624">Some critics thought compliance with SOX might be too costly. However, after more than a decade of enforcement, it is now clear to most that Sarbanes-Oxley was, and is, a necessary regulatory step. It has allowed for significant progress to be made in slowing down the kind of unethical conduct that led to the Enron fraud. Although SOX technically applies only to publicly traded companies, many private companies also adopt SOX-style internal controls and transparency, as do not-for-profits such as universities and hospitals.</p>

<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm203868464">While some argue that corporations have a primary duty to maximize profits for the benefit of shareholders, others assert that businesses have a duty to the society in which they operate, a duty that serves as the basis of the CSR philosophy. Many court cases have addressed the issue, but it has not been conclusively resolved.</p>
<p id="auto_6e4f527e-30ce-483e-bbd6-6632f5fc39cb_fs-idm215133984">Despite the ongoing ethical debate, being a good corporate citizen is a goal toward which most contemporary corporations strive. An effective CSR policy usually means that companies have to commit to both an internal and external approach to ethics. Corporate social responsibility and good corporate governance are in reality just two sides of the very same coin. Social responsibility does not mean lower profitability.</p>

<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm268568096">Adopting sustainability as a strategy means protecting the environment. Society has an interest in the long-term survival, indeed the flourishing, of ecological habitats and natural resources, and we ask and expect companies to respect this societal goal in their business activities.</p>
<p id="auto_510346b6-67fd-4c14-8e59-10883a9843ea_fs-idm247949600">When analyzing what a business owes society in return for the freedom to extract our natural resources, we must balance development and preservation. It may be easy to say from afar that a business should cut back on how much it pollutes the air, but what happens when that means cutting back on fossil fuel use and transitioning to electric vehicles, a choice that affects everyone on a personal level?</p>

<p id="auto_33d51151-9277-4eaf-9337-5da7cf08ea97_fs-idm398474000">One challenge in a free enterprise system is balancing the need for government regulation and private-sector corporate managers&#8217; need for independence in running their businesses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act tries to strike this balance by mandating transparency in corporate governance. This debate also includes the question whether businesses operating in the private sector ought to do public good on their own, regardless of whether the government mandates it. For example, many companies make a commitment to keep the environment clean, and to do so by going above and beyond what the law requires.</p>

They are a reflection of the underlying values of a society and the way society lives out those values over time. This experience is captured in language, culture, religious traditions, and modes of thinking, all of which have varied throughout history and influence the conduct of business in a range of ways.

<p id="auto_a672020b-6693-413b-b525-1d8c26191801_fs-idm207652848">Ethics is a construct of considerable significance to human beings. Some suggest ethics emerged to allow families and clans to cooperate in harsh environments. Others point to its use in governing trade and commerce, even simple bartering. Still others say ethical behavior is wired into the cognitive structures of the brain, explaining why we find codes of ethics and morality in texts as diverse as the Code of Hammurabi (a Babylonian code of law nearly four thousand years old), the Bible, the Napoleonic Code, and <em data-effect="italics">The Analects of Confucius</em>, all of which outline ways for people to live together in society.</p>



<p id="auto_a672020b-6693-413b-b525-1d8c26191801_fs-idm207827664">Whatever its origin, ethics has almost certainly existed throughout human time and varied with language, culture, history, and geography (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_a672020b-6693-413b-b525-1d8c26191801_OSX_Ethics_05_00_WorldMap">Figure 5.1</a>). Are there underlying values that transcend time and place, however? If so, do the protocols of business ethics embody these values? For instance, we see respect for others in Dubai, where tea accompanies negotiations; in Tokyo, where formal words and bows come first; and in Lima, where polite inquiries about the family precede business. Is respect, therefore, a universal value?</p>



<p id="auto_a672020b-6693-413b-b525-1d8c26191801_fs-idm235643216">In short, to what degree is any code of business ethics conditioned by culture, time, and geography? Given that individuals are responsible only for their own behavior, is it possible for business ethics to be universal?</p>

<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm343401936">It has been said that English is the language of money and, for that reason, has become the language of business, finance, trade, communication, and travel. As such, English carries with it the values and assumptions of its native speakers around the world. But not all cultures share these assumptions, at least not implicitly. The sick leave or vacation policies of a British investment bank, for instance, may vary greatly from those of a shoe manufacturer in Laos. Because business and capitalism as conducted today have evolved primarily from European origins and profits are measured against Western standards like the U.S. dollar, the ethics that emerges from them is also beholden primarily (but not exclusively) to Western conceptions of behavior. The challenge for business leaders everywhere is to draw out the values of local cultures and integrate the best of those into their management models. The opportunities for doing so are enormous given the growing impact of China, India, Russia, and Brazil in global commerce. The cultures of these countries will affect the dominant business model, possibly even defining new ethical standards.</p>

<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm334259120">To understand the influence of culture on business ethics, it is essential to understand the concepts of enculturation and acculturation. In its most basic anthropological sense, <span data-type="term" id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_term136" group-by="e">enculturation</span> refers to the process by which humans learn the rules, customs, skills, and values to participate in a society. In other words, no one is born with culture; all humans, regardless of their origin, have to learn what is considered appropriate behavior in their surrounding cultures. Whereas enculturation is the acquisition of any society&#8217;s norms and values, <span data-type="term" id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_term137" group-by="a">acculturation</span> refers specifically to the cultural transmission and socialization process that stems from cultural exchange. The effects of this blending of cultures appear in both the native (original) culture and the host (adopted) culture. Historically, acculturation has often been the result of military or political conquest. Today, it also comes about through economic development and the worldwide reach of the media.</p>

What unexamined assumptions by both parties led to problems between them?</p>
</div></div>
<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm347560544">Two major conditions affect the relationship between business and <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_term139" group-by="c">culture</span>. The first is that business is not culturally neutral. Today, it typically displays a mindset that is Western and primarily English-speaking and is reinforced by the enculturation process of Western nations, which tends to emphasize individualism and competition. In this tradition, <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_term140" group-by="b">business</span> is defined as the exchange of goods and services in a dedicated market for the purpose of commerce and creating value for its owners and investors. Thus, business is not open ended but rather directed toward a specific goal and supported by beliefs about labor, ownership, property, and rights.</p>
<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm325272992">In the West, we typically think of these beliefs in Western terms. This worldview explains the misunderstanding between Minuit, who assumed he was buying Manhattan, and the tribal leaders, who may have had in mind nothing of the sort but instead believed they were granting some use rights. The point is that a particular understanding of and approach to business are already givens in any particular culture. Businesspeople who work across cultures in effect have entered the theater in the middle of the movie, and often they must perform the translation work of business to put their understanding and approach into local cultural idioms. One example of this is the fact that you might find <em data-effect="italics">sambal</em> chili sauce in an Indonesian McDonald&#8217;s in place of Heinz ketchup, but the restaurant, nevertheless, is a McDonald&#8217;s.</p>

No longer can an organization maintain a purely bottom-line mentality; now it must consider ethics, and, therefore, social responsibility and sustainability, throughout its entire operation. As a result, local cultures are assuming a more aggressive role in defining their relationship with business prevalent in their regions.</c:para>
<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm339407600">Had this change taken place four centuries ago, that transaction in Manhattan might have gone a little differently. However, working across cultures can also create challenging ethical dilemmas, especially in regions where corruption is commonplace. A number of companies have experienced this problem, and globalization will likely only increase its incidence.</p>

<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm342448192">What about the ethical dimensions of a business in a developed country engaging in commerce in an environment where corruption might be more rampant than at home? How can an organization remain true to its mission and what it believes about itself while honoring local customs and ethical standards? The question is significant because it goes to the heart of the organization&#8217;s values, its operations, and its internal culture. What must a business do to engage with local culture while still fulfilling its purpose, whether managers see that purpose as profitability, social responsibility, or a balance between the two?</p>

The Manhattan purchase was successful to the degree that Minuit and the tribal leaders were willing to engage in an exchange of mutual benefit. Yet this revealed a transaction between two very different commercial cultures. Did each group truly understand the other&#8217;s perception of an exchange of goods and services? Furthermore, did the parties balance personal and collective beliefs for the greater good? Given the distinctions between these two cultures, would that even have been possible?</c:para>

<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm347123584">To paraphrase the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus (c. 535&#8211;475 BCE), the one constant in life is change. Traditional norms and customs have changed as the world&#8217;s population has grown more diverse and urbanized, and as the Internet has made news and other resources readily available. The growing emphasis on <span data-type="term" id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_term145" group-by="c">consumerism</span>&#8212;a lifestyle characterized by the acquisition of goods and services&#8212;has meant that people have become defined as &#8220;consumers&#8221; as opposed to citizens or human beings. Unfortunately, this emphasis eventually leads to the problem of diminishing marginal utility, with the consumer having to buy an ever-increasing amount to reach the same level of satisfaction.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_10161">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm337211728">At the same time, markets have become more diverse and interconnected. For example, South Korean companies like LG and Samsung employ 52,000 workers in the United States,<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_rf-011" id="60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d-endNote11"><sup class="os-end-note-number">11</sup></a> and many U.S. companies now manufacture their products abroad.

The individual consumer, for instance, may benefit from lower prices and a greater selection of goods, but only by supporting a company that might be engaged in unethical practices in its overseas supply or distribution chains. Producers&#8217; choices about wages, working conditions, environmental impact, child labor, taxation, and plant safety feature in the creation of each product brought to market. Becoming aware of these factors requires consumers to engage in an investigation of the business practices of those parties they will patronize and exercise a certain amount of cultural and ethical sensitivity.</c:para>

Throughout the 1990s, the U.S. shoe and sportswear manufacturer Nike was widely criticized for subcontracting with factories in China and Southeast Asia that were little more than sweatshops with deplorable working conditions. After responding to the criticisms and demanding that its suppliers improve their workplaces, the company began to redeem itself in the eyes of many and has become a model of business ethics and sustainability. However, questions remain about the relationship between business and government.</p>
<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm336133040">For instance, should a company advocate for labor rights, a minimum wage, and unionization in developing countries where it has operations? What responsibility does it have for the welfare of a contractor&#8217;s workers in a culture with differing customs? What right does any Western company have to insist that its foreign contractors observe in their factories the protocols required in the West? What, for example, is sacred about an eight-hour workday? When Nike demands that foreign manufacturers observe Western laws and customs about the workplace, arguably this is capitalist imperialism. Not only that, but Western firms will be charged more for concessions regarding factory conditions. Perhaps this is as it should be, but Western consumers must then be prepared to pay more for material goods than in the past.</p>
<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm338798768">Some argue that demanding that companies accept these responsibilities imposes cultural standards on another culture through economic pressure. Others insist there should be universal standards of humane employee treatment, and that they must be met regardless of where they come from or who imposes them. But should the market dictate such standards, or should the government?</p>

It may be cheaper and more efficient to bring these operations back to developed countries and use robotic systems instead. What would that mean for local cultures and their economies? In Nike&#8217;s case, automation is already a concern, particularly as competition from its German rival, Adidas, heats up again.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_rf-012" id="60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d-endNote12"><sup class="os-end-note-number">12</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm339675984">In considering the ethical challenges presented by the outsourcing of production to lower costs and increase profits, let us return to the example of IBM. IBM has a responsibility to provide technology products of high quality at affordable prices in line with its beliefs about client success, innovation, and trust. If it achieved these ends in a fraudulent or otherwise illegal way, it would be acting irresponsibly and in violation of both U.S. and host country laws and as well as the company&#8217;s own code of ethics. These constraints appear to leave little room for unethical behavior, yet in a globalized world of intense competition, the temptation to do anything possible to carve out an advantage can be overpowering. This choice between ends and means is reminiscent of the philosophers Aristotle and Kant, both of whom believed it impossible to achieve just ends through unjust means.</p>
<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm350281360">But what about consumer responsibility and the impact on the global community? Western consumers tend to perceive <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_term147" group-by="g">globalization</span> as a phenomenon intended to benefit them specifically. In general, they have few compunctions about Western businesses offshoring their manufacturing operations as long as it ultimately benefits them as consumers. However, even in business, ethics is not about consumption but rather about human morality, a greater end. Considering an expansion of domestic markets, what feature of this process enables us to become more humane rather than simply pickier consumers or wasteful spenders? It is the opportunity to encounter other cultures and people, increasing our ethical awareness and sensitivity. Seen in this way, globalization affects the human condition. It raises no less a question than what kind of world we want to leave to our children and grandchildren.</p>

<li>Describe the ways ethical standards change over time</li>
<li>Identify major shifts in technology and ethical thinking over the last five hundred years</li>
<li>Explain the impact of government and self-imposed regulation on ethical standards and practices in the United States</li>

<p id="auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_fs-idm351354656">Besides culture, the other major influence in the development of business ethics is the passage of time. Ethical standards do not remain fixed; they transform in response to evolving situations. Over time, people change, technology advances, and cultural mores (i.e., acquired culture and manners) shift. What was considered an appropriate or accepted business practice one hundred or even fifty years ago may not carry the same moral weight it once did. However, this does not mean ethics and moral behavior are relative. It simply acknowledges that attitudes change in relationship to historical events and that cultural perspective and the process of acculturation are not stagnant.</p>

<p id="auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_fs-idm342376880">We find an example of changing cultural mores in the fashion industry, where drastic evolution can occur even over ten years, let alone a century. The changes can be more than simply stylistic ones. Clothing reflects people&#8217;s view of themselves, their world, and their values. A woman in the first half of the twentieth century might be very proud to wear a fox stole with its head and feet intact (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_OSX_Ethics_05_02_Fox">Figure 5.4</a>). Today, many would consider that an ethical faux pas, even as the use of fur remains common in the industry despite active campaigns against it by organizations such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. At the same time, cosmetics manufacturers increasingly pledge not to test their products on animals, reflecting changing awareness of animals&#8217; rights.</p>

<p id="auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_fs-idm343354224">Bias is built into the human psyche and expressed through our social structures. For this reason, we should avoid making snap judgments about past eras based on today&#8217;s standards. The challenge, of course, is to know which values are situational&#8212;that is, although many values and ethics are relative and subjective, others are objectively true, at least to most people. We can hardly argue in favor of slavery, for example, no matter in which culture or historical era it was practiced. Of course, although some values strike us as universal, the ways in which they are interpreted and applied vary over time, so that what was once acceptable no longer is, or the reverse.</p>

Nearly everyone smoked, from judges in court to factory workers and pregnant women. Edward Bernays, the Austrian-American founder of the field of public relations, promoted smoking among women in a 1929 campaign in New York City in which he marketed Lucky Strike cigarettes as &#8220;torches of freedom&#8221; that would lead to equality between men and women. However, by the late 1960s, and in the wake of the release of the landmark Surgeon General&#8217;s report on &#8220;Smoking and Health&#8221; on January 11, 1964, it had become clear that there was a direct link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Subsequent research has added heart and lung diseases, stroke, and diabetes. Smoking has decreased in Western countries but remains well established in the global East and South, where cigarette manufacturers actively promote the products in markets like Brazil, China, Russia, and Singapore, especially among young people.</p>

But this realization raises some basic questions. First, what should we discard and what should we keep from the past? Second, on what basis should we make this decision? Third, is history cumulative, progressing onward and upward through time, or does it unfold in different and more complicated ways, sometimes circling back upon itself?</p>

Each of these periods has had a different impact on ethics and what is considered acceptable business practice. Some economists believe there may even be a postglobalization phase arising from populist movements throughout the world that question the benefits of free trade and call for protective measures, like import barriers and export subsidies, to reassert national sovereignty.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_rf-001" id="c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5-endNote13"><sup class="os-end-note-number">13</sup></a> In some ways, these protectionist reactions represent a return to the theories and policies that were popular in the age of mercantilism.</c:para>

Under mercantilism, from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, the exploration of newly opened markets and trade routes coincided with the impulse to colonize, producing an ethical code that valued acculturation by means of trade and often brute force. European powers extracted raw commodities like cotton, silk, diamonds, tea, and tobacco from their colonies in Africa, Asia, and South America and brought them home for production. Few questioned the practice, and the operation of business ethics consisted mainly of protecting owners&#8217; interests.</p>

The goal was to earn as high a profit as possible for shareholders, with little concern for outside stakeholders. Charles Dickens (1812&#8211;1870) famously exposed the conditions of factory work and the poverty of the working class in many of his novels, as did the American writer Upton Sinclair (1878&#8211;1968). Although these periods witnessed extraordinary developments in science, medicine, engineering, and technology, the state of business ethics was perhaps best described by critics like Ida <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_term149" group-by="T">Tarbell</span> (1857&#8211;1944), who said of industrialist John D. <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_term150" group-by="R">Rockefeller</span> (1839&#8211;1937) (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_OSX_Ethics_05_02_TarbellRoc">Figure 5.5</a>), &#8220;Would you ask for scruples in an electric dynamo?&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_rf-002" id="c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5-endNote14"><sup class="os-end-note-number">14</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_fs-idm336898816">What effect does time have on business ethics, and how is this effect achieved? If we accept that business today has two purposes&#8212;profitability and responsibility&#8212;we might assume that business ethics is in a much better position now than in the past to affect conduct across industries. However, much of the transformation of business over time has been the result of direct government intervention; one recent example is the Dodd&#8211;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that followed the financial crisis of 2008. Yet, despite such regulation and increased management vigilance in the form of ethics training, compliance reporting, whistleblower programs, and audits, it is tempting to conclude that business ethics is in worse shape than ever. The Information Age and the Internet may even have facilitated unethical behavior by making it easier to move large sums of money around undetected, by enabling the spread of misinformation on a global scale, and by exposing the public to the theft and misuse of vast stores of personal data gathered by companies as diverse as Equifax and Facebook.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_79027">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm349244576">However, since the mercantile era, there has been a gradual increase in awareness of the ethical dimension of business. As we saw in the preceding chapter, businesses and the U.S. government have debated and litigated the role of corporate social responsibility throughout the twentieth century, first validating the rule of shareholder primacy in <em data-effect="italics">Dodge v. Ford Motor Company</em> (1919) and then moving away from a strict interpretation of it in <em data-effect="italics">Shlensky v. Wrigley</em> (1968). In <em data-effect="italics">Dodge v. Ford Motor Company</em> (1919), the Michigan Supreme Court famously ruled that Ford had to operate in the interests of its shareholders as opposed to its employees and managers, which meant prioritizing profit and return on investment. This court decision was made even though Henry Ford had said, &#8220;My ambition is to employ still more men, to spread the benefits of this industrial system to the greatest possible number, to help them build up their lives and their homes. To do this we are putting the greatest share of our profits back in the business.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_rf-006" id="c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5-endNote18"><sup class="os-end-note-number">18</sup></a> By mid-century and the case of <em data-effect="italics">Shlensky v.

<p id="auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_fs-idm351007904">Whenever we look at the ways in which our perception of ethical business practice changes over time, we should note that such change is not necessarily good or bad but rather a function of human nature and of the ways in which our views are influenced by our environment, our culture, and the passage of time. Many of the examples discussed thus far illustrate a gradual increase in social awareness due to the actions of individual leaders and the historical era in which they found themselves. This does not mean that culture is irrelevant, but that human nature exists and ethical inclination is part of that nature. Historical conditions may allow this nature to be expressed more or less fully. We might measure ethical standards according to the degree they allow human compassion to direct business practice or, at least, make it easier for compassion to hold sway. We might then consider ethics not just a nicety but a constitutive part of business, because it is an inherent human trait. This is a perspective Kant and Rawls might have agreed with. Ethical thinking over time should be measured, deliberate, and open to examination.</p>

<p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm346358816">Global relationships teach us to be sensitive not just to other languages and customs but also to other people&#8217;s worldviews. A company looking to move its production to another country may be interested in setting up supply, distribution, and value chains that support human rights, worker safety, and equity for women, while the local culture is excited about the economic benefits it will gain from the company&#8217;s investment in employment and the local tax base and infrastructure. These goals need not be in conflict, but they must be integrated if the company is to reach an ethically sound agreement with the host country. Dialogue and openness are crucial to this process, just as they are in every other kind of relationship.</p>
<p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm323539536">Geography affects a business&#8217;s relationship with almost any type of stakeholder, from stockholders and employees to customers, the government, and the environment. Hence the growing importance of <span data-type="term" id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_term152" group-by="l">localization</span>, the process of adapting a product for non-native environments and languages, especially other nations and cultures. Such adaption often starts with language translation but may include customizing content or products to the tastes and consumption habits of the local market; converting currencies, dates, and other measurements to regional standards; and addressing community regulations and legal requirements.</p>

<p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm339044320">One element of business culture you may not realize is based on local custom and culture is the notion of time. Unlike the notion of historical time discussed in the previous module, the concept of time in business&#8212;people&#8217;s approach to punctuality, for example&#8212;varies widely in different cultures. To put it in economic terms, all cultures share the resource of time, but they measure and use that resource very differently. These differences might significantly affect the foundation of any business relationships you may want to establish around the world. For this and many other reasons, basic cultural literacy must be at the forefront of any ethical system that governs business behavior.</p>
<p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm308390864">Consider, for example, that in the United States, we might speak of &#8220;a New York minute,&#8221; &#8220;the nick of time,&#8221; &#8220;the eleventh hour,&#8221; and so on. Such expressions make sense in a culture where the enculturation process emphasizes competition and speed. But even among Western business cultures, conceptions of time can differ. For example, the Italian <em data-effect="italics">subito</em> and the German <em data-effect="italics">sofort</em> both refer to something happening &#8220;at once&#8221; or &#8220;straightaway,&#8221; but with different expectations about when the action, in fact, will take place. And some cultures do not measure the passage of time at all.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_81174">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm341434752">Generally, the farther east and south we travel from the United States, the more time becomes relational rather than chronological. In Kenya, <em data-effect="italics">tutaonana baadaye</em> means &#8220;see you later,&#8221; although &#8220;later&#8221; could be any time, open to context and interpretation. The nomadic inhabitants of North Africa known as the Tuareg sit down to tea before discussing any business, and as a rule, the longer the time spent in preliminary conversation, the better. A Tuareg proverb has it that the first cup of tea is bitter like life, the second sweet like love, and the third gentle like death.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_rf-003" id="0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e-endNote23"><sup class="os-end-note-number">23</sup></a> Compare this with the Western attitude that &#8220;time flies&#8221; and &#8220;time is money.&#8221; Finally, Westerners doing business in some English-speaking African countries have learned that if they want something immediately, they have to say &#8220;now now&#8221; as &#8220;now&#8221; by itself does not convey the desired sense of immediacy.</c:para>
<p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm308526176">Another aspect of international business relationships is the question of personal space. In Nigeria, for example, standing either too close or too far from someone to whom you are speaking might be seen as impolite. In some cultures, touch is important in establishing connection, whereas in others it may be frowned upon. As a general rule, &#8220;contact&#8221; cultures&#8212;where people stand closer together when interacting, touch more often, and have more frequent direct eye contact&#8212;are found in South America, the Middle East, and southern Europe, while &#8220;noncontact&#8221; cultures&#8212;where eye contact and touching are less frequent, and there is less physical proximity during interactions&#8212;are in northern Europe, the Far East, and the United States. So, the seemingly innocuous gesture of a handshake to cement a new business relationship might be viewed very differently depending on where it occurs and who is shaking hands.</p>
<p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm324456720">All of this speaks to the awareness and cultural sensitivity that must be exhibited by an ethical manager doing business in a region different from his or her own. Certain mistakes, particularly accidental ones and those not motivated by malicious design, will likely be forgiven. Still, a global ethical demeanor requires that we be as conscious as possible as to what constitutes courtesy wherever we find ourselves conducting business.</p>
<div class="what-would" data-type="note" id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm367207984"><h3 class="os-title" data-type="title"><span class="os-title-label">What Would You Do?</span></h3><div class="os-note-body"><h4 data-type="title" id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_42653" class="os-subtitle"><span class="os-subtitle-label">Tucked In, Tucked Out</span></h4><p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm344482496">Time and space are just two examples of cultural characteristics that you may take for granted but that are not universal. Business attire is another, as is humor, which is notoriously hard to translate across languages and cultures. And, of course, miscommunications can occur not just across regional boundaries and business cultures but even within them. For example, unless you are a barista at a hipster coffee bar, it may not be a good idea to wear piercings, tattoos, or colorfully dyed hair to work. Employers have the right to establish a dress code and expect employees to abide by it.</p>
<p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm325891184">In the movie <em data-effect="italics">The Intern</em>, Robert De Niro&#8217;s senior character wears conservative blue and gray suits to his job at an e-commerce fashion startup, whereas the younger men dress very casually. At one point in the film, De Niro&#8217;s character asks, &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t anybody tuck in their shirt?&#8221; Leaving your shirt untucked has become more acceptable in recent years, and the black t-shirt and jeans favored in Silicon Valley are now quite fashionable in some business environments.</p>

The age of uncomfortable dresses and starched white shirts may be over, but cultural standards, along with underlying values that prioritize, say, innovation over uniformity, change over time and even within the same company.</p>

<p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm341585680">A major factor in the difference that geography and culture make in our ethical standards is the influence of religious practice. For example, just as the current debate over the redistribution of goods and services has Christian roots, so the Industrial Revolution in England and northern Europe looked to Protestant Christianity in particular for the values of frugality, hard work, industriousness, and simplicity. Until the seventeenth century, <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_term153" group-by="r">religion</span> and ethics were nearly inseparable. Many believed that people could not be persuaded to do the right thing without the threat of eternal damnation. The Enlightenment&#8217;s attempt to peel religion away from ethics was short-lived, with even Kant acknowledging the need to base morality on something beyond the rationalism of his time.</p>
<p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm361929936">Religions are neither uniform nor monolithic, of course, nor are they unchanging over time. The core of Christianity, for instance, does not change, but its emphasis in any given period does. Moreover, the state or crown often worked side by side with the church in the past, choosing certain teachings over others to promote its own interests. This cooperation was evident during the era of mercantilism when the issue of personhood, or the privilege of having the freedom and capacity to make decisions and act morally, was hotly debated in the context of slavery, a practice that had been going on for centuries in the Christian West and the Islamic East. Although the church officially opposed slavery, the conquest of new lands was justified theologically as bringing salvation and civilization to populations considered savage and unsophisticated. Christianity was thought to save them from their pagan ways just as Islam and the message of the prophet saved unbelievers in the East. Behavioral norms for the clergy were founded and supported by the divine right of kings and the authority of religious tradition (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_OSX_Ethics_05_03_EthicsCult">Figure 5.6</a>). Commerce and trade followed these norms.</p>

In fact, the Protestant work ethic, religion, and a commitment to hard work all are intertwined in the business history of both these countries. One example of this singular association is John D. <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_term154" group-by="R">Rockefeller</span>, who, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, commanded the attention given today to Bill Gates and Warren Buffet as emblems of free enterprise.</p>

In making his fortune, he pursued markedly Darwinian practices revealing a conviction in survival of the fittest. Later in life, and as his philanthropic motivation increased, his endowment of several charitable causes more fully reflected his belief as to how God wished him to dispose of a sizable portion of his wealth.</p>

All three of these religions teach that no harm should be done to others, nor should people be treated as means toward a material end like wealth. Yet what role does a religious concept of stewardship play in the ethics of the twenty-first century? The Enlightenment attempted to separate religion and ethics but could not. Are the two concepts inextricably linked? Might the business leaders of today succeed where the Enlightenment failed?</p>

Is it possible to identify a set of universal values that is consistent across cultures and time? We might begin with always honoring the terms of a contract, consistently treating customers and partners with honesty, and never cheating. Where could we go from there? No matter our culture, geography, or time, could we identify some basic normative behaviors to govern business conduct in general?</p>

At the organizational and societal levels, laws, regulations, and oversight can go a long way toward curtailing illegal activity. Business ethics motivates managers to (1) meet legal and industry governing and reporting requirements and (2) shape corporate culture so that corrupt practices such as bribery, embezzlement, and fraud have no place in the organization. In the ideal case, the organization&#8217;s culture never allows the latter, because scandals not only damage reputations but they make companies and countries much less attractive to investors. Corruption is expensive: According to the World Economic Forum, no less than $2 trillion is lost each year worldwide as a result of corruption, a staggering waste not just of resources but of credibility for business in general.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888_rf-003" id="b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888-endNote28"><sup class="os-end-note-number">28</sup></a></c:para>

Corruption can be defeated only by individuals acting in accordance with their conscience and being supported by systems and corporate culture that encourage such action. Transparency, whistleblower programs, ethics training, and modeling of appropriate behavior by upper management can create the conditions for employees to act ethically, but conscience is a personal phenomenon. So, although the work of national, regional, and international organizations can limit corruption through enforcement and the prosecution of cases (as was the case with the revelation of the so-called Panama Papers), corruption will not be reduced in any significant way unless efforts have been made to form individual conscience and teach practical ways to act on it.</p>

For example, although what constitutes ethical behavior in Islamic society is strongly linked to religious values, secular philosophers can endorse a highly developed commitment to commercial ethics, too. Furthermore, most religions have high ethical standards but do not address many of the problems faced in business. And although a good system of law incorporates ethical standards, the law can and sometimes does deviate from what is ethical. Finally, in the same vein, ethics is not science. The social and natural sciences provide data to make better ethical choices, but science cannot tell people what they ought to do (nor should it).</p>
<p id="auto_b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888_fs-idm347281776">Absolute values do exist. Abstaining from cheating customers, defrauding clients, lying, and murder are fairly objective ethical values; the reason for making any exceptions must be carefully laid out. Ethical systems, whether utilitarian, rights based, or based on natural law and virtue ethics, are attempts to translate absolute values like these into workable solutions for people. From these systems has emerged a basic set of ethical norms for the business world.</p>

Organizational responsibility is fairly straightforward: Comply with applicable local, state, national, and international regulations. Compliance can be an immense task for industries like aerospace, pharmaceuticals, banking, and food production, due to the large number of employees involved, the certification of them that sometimes is necessary, and the requisite record keeping. Still, legal requirements are usually clear, as are the ways an organization can exceed them (as do, for example, companies such as Whole Foods, Zappos, and Starbucks). Personal responsibility is a different matter. It is either less clear what to do or harder to do it because of constant pressure to increase the organization&#8217;s profitability and the perception that &#8220;everybody else is doing it.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888_rf-004" id="b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888-endNote29"><sup class="os-end-note-number">29</sup></a></c:para>

Federal Sentencing Guidelines for felonies and serious misdemeanors now carry mandatory prison time for individual executives who are convicted. These guidelines also are designed to help organizations with compliance and reporting, and they introduce seven steps toward that end: (1) create a Code of Ethics, (2) introduce high-level oversight, (3) place ethical people in positions of authority, (4) communicate ethics standards, (5) facilitate employee reporting of misconduct, (6) react and respond to instances of misconduct, and (7) take preventive steps.</c:para>

The 2017 conviction for bribery and embezzlement of Lee Jae-yong, heir to the Samsung electronics empire, was part of a widespread corruption scandal that brought down the president of South Korea. Bribery was also at the heart of the FIFA (F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale de Football Association) corruption scandal, in which soccer officials, marketing executives, and broadcasters were accused of racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015. The Volkswagen emissions scandal also began in 2015, when the Environmental Protection Agency cited the German automaker for violating the Clean Air Act by cheating on emissions tests. To date, the fallout has cost the company nearly $30 billion in fines.</p>

Human flourishing may not be the immediate concern of business, but managers and employees have a significant impact on business performance. Giving employees common-sense advice and training in practical ways to counter unethical behavior, as well as ethical role models at the top of the organization, can be more effective than prevention. There are programs that do this, such as &#8220;Giving Voice to Values&#8221; at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888_rf-010" id="b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888-endNote35"><sup class="os-end-note-number">35</sup></a> These programs are effective for their ability to help individuals act on their principles.

In this model, organizations focus on employees as a vital part of the operation and support them in their professional training, health care, education, family responsibilities, and even spiritual concerns. Leaders create positive relationships with stakeholders, including their employees, to cultivate investor goodwill and because they believe in the underlying values of trust and authenticity. The influence of positive psychology is evident, and there is much to commend in this kinder approach to the job of management that makes an effort to establish &#8220;sustainable human welfare.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888_rf-011" id="b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888-endNote36"><sup class="os-end-note-number">36</sup></a> However, happy employees are one thing; the human flourishing identified by Aristotle and John Stuart Mill is quite another.

<p id="auto_b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888_fs-idm347346000">The problem is that if anything flourishes in this model, it is often the business rather than the employees. After all, free enterprise has the interests of the enterprise at heart. But employees are human beings first, which means any attempt to improve their welfare must begin by thinking of them as human beings rather than as employees. How can businesses do this?</p>
<p id="auto_b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888_fs-idm333346944">One alternative is to put the humanities into business. Businesses currently rely heavily on data analytics, algorithms, and statistical analyses to drive decision-making. The use of these tools is often backed by social science research in consumer behavior, behavioral finance, and cognitive studies. But looking to the humanities to understand business is an opportunity to engage business in subjects and ideas that have a tremendous, if often overlooked, impact on people. After all, literature that has stood the test of time can provide tremendous insight into human behavior, and Homer or Shakespeare may be more relevant to contemporary executive leadership than a business seminar on how to motivate employees.</p>

Bias also rewards those who support and nurture the best elements of a culture, whether corporate, social, or political. But it becomes dangerous when people use it to blind themselves to the reality around them, reinforce hardened positions even in the face of contradictory evidence, and shirk their responsibility as moral beings.</p>
<p id="auto_b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888_fs-idm339387744">An example of bias occurs when employees engage in unethical activity because it has been sanctioned by higher-ups. They abdicate personal responsibility by assigning blame elsewhere. However, no amount of rationalization of the fear of job loss, financial pressure, desire to please a supervisor, and the rest, can justify such behavior, because it diminishes <span data-type="term" id="auto_b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888_term162" group-by="m">moral agency</span>, the self-awareness, freedom, and ability to make choices based on our perception of right and wrong. And such agency needs to be at the heart of business ethics. After all, we cannot make a commitment to serve customers, develop leaders, and improve life for all stakeholders unless there is freedom and moral agency, the necessary ingredients in establishing an attitude of concern, that is, respect for oneself and for others, including all appropriate stakeholders.</p>

<p id="auto_60b95954-d401-4eb0-8f19-ab8befae591d_fs-idm337777552">Culture has a tremendous influence on ethics and its application in a business setting. In fact, we can argue that culture and ethics cannot be separated, because ethical norms have been established over time by and make sense to people who share the same background, language, and customs. For its part, business operates within at least two cultures: its organizational culture and the wider culture in which it was founded. When a business attempts to establish itself in a new environment, a third culture comes into play. With increasingly diverse domestic and global markets and the spread of consumerism, companies must consider the ethical implications of outsourcing production and resist the temptation to look the other way when their values are challenged by the reality of overseas supply or distribution chains.</p>

<p id="auto_c97cd1a5-ff68-4c03-9c61-73fd00f804d5_fs-idm351362608">As a function of culture, ethics is not static but changes in each new era. Technology is a driving force in ethical shifts, as we can see in tracing changes from the age of mercantilism to the Industrial Revolution to the postindustrial era and the Information Age. Some of the most successful recent efforts to advance ethical practices have come from influences outside industry, including government regulation and consumer pressure.</p>

<p id="auto_0d582524-396a-4d41-8684-cd23bc80268e_fs-idm310432688">Business is primarily about relationships&#8212;with employees, business partners, and customers and clients. Ethical standards and practices governing these relationships depend on the environment they exist in, an environment that, in turn, depends on additional factors such as geography and religion. Religion&#8217;s role in business is less certain today; we are perhaps more likely to see a universal, secular code of ethics develop than to see religion serve as common ground for different cultures to come together.</p>

<p id="auto_b3a82e64-b921-4fc4-93ee-c9bbef0d6888_fs-idm347805136">Any system of business ethics must consider the processes of enculturation and acculturation as well as the fact that ethical standards may shift depending on geography or time, even if certain underlying ethical values (e.g., prohibitions against lying, fraud, or murder) may remain constant. It is usually in a business&#8217;s best interest to promote human flourishing within the organization, providing comprehensive training along a humanistic business model, which applies the social sciences to ensure profitability and responsibility in an organization as well as happy, productive employees.</p>

<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm392130160">All employees want and deserve a workplace that is physically and emotionally safe, where they can focus on their job responsibilities and obtain some fulfillment, rather than worrying about dangerous conditions, harassment, or discrimination. Workers also expect fair pay and respect for their privacy. This section will explore the ethical and legal duties of employers to provide a workplace in which employees want to work.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm394138960"><h3 data-type="title">Ethical Decision-Making and Leadership in the Workplace</h3>
<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm390712000">A contemporary corporation always owes an ethical, and in some cases legal, duty to employees to be a <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_term163" group-by="r">responsible employer</span>. In a business context, the definition of this responsibility includes providing a safe workplace, compensating workers fairly, and treating them with a sense of dignity and equality while respecting at least a minimum of their privacy. Managers should be ethical leaders who serve as role models and mentors for all employees. A manager&#8217;s job, perhaps the most important one, is to give people a reason to come back to work tomorrow.</p>
<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm395567776">Good managers model ethical behavior. If a corporation expects its employees to act ethically, that behavior must start at the top, where managers hold themselves to a high standard of conduct and can rightly say, &#8220;Follow my lead, do as I do.&#8221; At a minimum, leaders model ethical behavior by not violating the law or company policy. One who says, &#8220;Get this deal done, I don&#8217;t care what it takes,&#8221; may very well be sending a message that unethical tactics and violating the spirit, if not the letter, of the law are acceptable. A manager who abuses company property by taking home office supplies or using the company&#8217;s computers for personal business but then disciplines any employee who does the same is not modeling ethical behavior. Likewise, a manager who consistently leaves early but expects all other employees to stay until the last minute is not demonstrating fairness.</p>
<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm390011248">Another responsibility business owes the workforce is <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_term164" group-by="t">transparency</span>. This duty begins during the hiring process, when the company communicates to potential employees exactly what is expected of them. Once hired, employees should receive training on the company rules and expectations. Management should explain how an employee&#8217;s work contributes to the achievement of company-wide goals. In other words, a company owes it to its employees to keep them in the loop about significant matters that affect them and their job, whether good or bad, formal or informal. A more complete understanding of all relevant information usually results in a better working relationship.</p>
<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm397723744">That said, some occasions do arise when full transparency may not be warranted. If a company is in the midst of confidential negotiations to acquire, or be acquired by, another firm, this information must be kept secret until a deal has been completed (or abandoned). Regulatory statutes and criminal law may require this. Similarly, any internal personnel performance issues or employee criminal investigations should normally be kept confidential within the ranks of management.</p>
<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm383546736">Transparency can be especially important to workers in circumstances that involve major changes, such as layoffs, reductions in the workforce, plant closings, and other consequential events. These kinds of events typically have a psychological and financial impact on the entire workforce. However, some businesses fail to show leadership at the most crucial times. A leader who is honest and open with the employees should be able to say, &#8220;This is a very difficult decision, but one that I made and will stand behind and accept responsibility for it.&#8221; To workers, euphemisms such as &#8220;right sizing&#8221; to describe layoffs and job loss only sounds like corporate doublespeak designed to help managers justify, and thereby feel better (and minimize guilt), about their (or the company&#8217;s) decisions. An ethical company will give workers advance notice, a severance package, and assistance with the employment search, without being forced to do so by law. Proactive rather than reactive behavior is the ethical and just thing to do.</p>
<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm389120032">Historically, however, a significant number of companies and managers failed to demonstrate ethical leadership in downsizing, eventually leading Congress to take action. The <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_term165" group-by="W">Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act</span> of 1989 has now been in effect for almost three decades, protecting workers and their families (as well as their communities) by mandating that employers provide sixty days&#8217; advance notice of mass layoffs and plant closings (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_OSX_Ethics_06_01_WARN">Figure 6.2</a>). This law was enacted precisely because companies were not behaving ethically.</p>

Only 7 percent had two months&#8217; notice of their impending displacement.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_rf-001" id="98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f-endNote4"><sup class="os-end-note-number">4</sup></a> Employers typically preferred to get as many days of work as possible from their workforces before a mass layoff or closing, figuring that workers might reduce productivity or look for other jobs sooner if the company were transparent and open about its situation. In other words, when companies put their own interests and needs ahead of the workforce, we can hardly call that ethical leadership.</c:para>
<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm397406304">Other management actions covered by WARN include outsourcing, automation, and artificial intelligence in the workplace. Arguably, a company has an ethical duty to notify workers who might be adversely affected even if the WARN law does not apply, demonstrating that the appropriate ethical standard for management often exceeds the minimum requirements of the law. Put another way, the law sometimes is often slow to keep up with ethical reflection on best management practices.</p>

The harasser can be the victim&#8217;s supervisor (which creates company liability the first time it happens) or a peer coworker (which usually creates liability after the second time it happens, assuming the company had notice of the first occurrence).

The Ford Motor Company serves as a relevant example. Decades after Ford tried to address sexual harassment at two Chicago-area assembly plants, the abuse at the plants evidently continues. According to legal action filed with the EEOC in the early 1990s, conditions for women working at some Ford auto assembly plants were hostile. Female employees alleged they were groped, that men pressed against them and simulated sex acts, and that men even masturbated in front of them. They further asserted that men would routinely make crude comments about the figures of female coworkers, and graffiti depictions of penises were everywhere&#8212;carved into tables, spray painted onto floors, and scribbled on walls. Managers and floor supervisors were accused of giving women better assignments in return for sex and punishing those who refused.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_rf-011" id="98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f-endNote14"><sup class="os-end-note-number">14</sup></a></c:para>

However, it seems Ford still did not learn its lesson, or, after almost three decades, the memory dimmed and they slipped right back into old habits. In August 2017, the EEOC reached a new $10 million settlement with Ford for sexual and racial harassment at the two Chicago plants. Though Ford did not admit any wrongdoing in the recent settlement, it appears that neither millions of dollars in earlier damages nor promises by management led to any serious change.

<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm394648336">Although the workplace should be free of harassment and intimidation of every sort, and management should provide a setting where all employees are treated with dignity and respect, ideally, employers should go much further.</p>
<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm391782864">Most people spend at least one-third and possibly as much as one-half of their waking hours at work. Management, therefore, should make work a place where people can thrive, that fosters an atmosphere in which they can be engaged and productive. Workers are happier when they like where they work and when they do not have to worry about childcare, health insurance, or being able to leave early on occasion to attend a child&#8217;s school play, for example. For our grandparents&#8217; generation, a good job was dependably steady, and employees tended to stay with the same employer for years. There were not many extras other than a secure job, health insurance, and a pension plan. However, today&#8217;s workers expect these traditional <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_term172" group-by="b">benefits</span> and more. They may even be willing to set aside some salary demands in exchange for an environment featuring perquisites (or &#8220;perks&#8221;; nonmonetary benefits) such as a park-like campus, an on-the-premises gym or recreational center, flextime schedules, on-site day care and dry cleaning, a gourmet coffee house or caf&#233;, and more time off. This section will explore how savvy managers establish a harmonious, compassionate workplace while still setting expectations of top performance.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_58108">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm397326816">Happy employees are more productive and more focused, which enhances their performance and leads to better customer treatment, fewer sick days, fewer on-the-job accidents, and less stress and burnout. They are more focused on their work, more creative, and better team players, and they are more likely to help others and demonstrate more leadership qualities. How, then, does an employer go about the process of making workers happy? Research has identified several pitfalls that managers should avoid if they want to have a good working relationship with their direct reports and, indeed, all their employees.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_rf-013" id="98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f-endNote16"><sup class="os-end-note-number">16</sup></a> One is making employees feel like they are <em data-effect="italics">just</em> employees. To be happy at work, employees, instead, need to feel like they know each other, have friends at work, are valued, and belong. Another pitfall is remaining aloof or above your employees. Taking an authentic interest in who they are as people really does matter. When surveys ask employees, &#8220;Do you feel like your boss cares about you?,&#8221; too frequently the answer is no. One way to show caring and interest is to recognize when employees are making progress; another might be to take a personal interest in their lives and families. Asking employees to share their ideas and implementing these ideas whenever possible is another form of acknowledgement and recognition. Pause and highlight important milestones people achieve, and ensure that they feel their contributions are noticed by saying thank you.</c:para>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_86121">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm398811760">Good advice to new managers includes making work fun. Allow people to joke around as appropriate so that when mistakes occur they can find humor in the situation and move forward without fixating simply on the downside. Celebrate accomplishments. Camaraderie and the right touch of humor can build a stronger workplace culture. Encourage exercise and sleep rather than long work hours, because those two factors improve employees&#8217; health, focus, attention, creativity, energy, and mood. In the long run, expecting or encouraging people to regularly work long hours because leaving on time looks bad is counterproductive to the goals of a firm. Accept that employees need to disengage sometimes. People who feel they are always working because their management team expects they must remain in touch via e-mail or mobile phone can become tremendously stressed. To combat this, companies should not expect their workers to be available around the clock, and workers should not feel compelled to be so available. Rather, employers should allow employees to completely disengage regularly so they can focus on their friends and families and tend to their own personal priorities. By way of international comparison, according to a recent article in <em data-effect="italics">Fortune</em>, Germany and France have actually gone as far as banning work-related e-mails from employers on the weekends, which is a step in the right direction, even if only because disconnecting from work is now mandated by law.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_rf-014" id="98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f-endNote17"><sup class="os-end-note-number">17</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm381877216">Employers must decide exactly how to spend the resources they have allocated to labor, and it can be challenging to make the right decision about what to provide workers (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_OSX_Ethics_06_02_Perks">Figure 6.5</a>). Should managers ask employees what they want? Benchmark the competition? Follow the founder&#8217;s or the board&#8217;s recommendations? How does a company make lifestyle benefits fair and act ethically when there is backlash against family-friendly policies from people who do not have their own families? Unlike the purchase of raw materials, utilities, and other budgetary items, which is driven primarily by cost and may present only a few choices, management&#8217;s offering of employee benefits can present dozens of options, with costs ranging from minimal to very high. Work-at-home programs may actually cost the company very little, for example, whereas health insurance benefits may cost significantly more. In many other industrialized countries, the government provides (i.e., subsidizes) benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans, so a company does not have to weigh the pros and cons (i.e., do a cost-benefit analysis) of what to offer in this area. In the United States, employee benefits become part of a cost-benefit analysis, especially for small and mid-sized companies. Even larger companies today are debating what benefits to offer.</p>

<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm381903968">Management has to decide not only how much money to spend on benefits and perks but precisely what to spend the money on. Another decision is what benefit choices management should allow each employee to make, and which choices to make for the workforce as a whole. The best managers communicate regularly with their workforce; as a result, they are more likely to know (and be able inform top management about) the types of perks most desired and most likely to attract and keep good workers. <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_OSX_Ethics_06_02_Benefits">Figure 6.6</a> shows that men and women do not always want the same benefits, which presents a challenge for management. For instance, many women place about twice as much value as many men do on day care (23%&#8211;11%) and on paid family leave (24%&#8211;14%). Also valued more highly generally by women than by men are better health insurance, work-from-home options, and flexible hours, whereas more men value an on-site gym and free coffee more than women typically do.</p>

For example, Google is constantly searching for ways to improve the health, well-being, and morale of its &#8220;Googlers.&#8221; The company is famous for offering unusual perks, like bicycles and electric cars to get staff around its sprawling California campus. Additional benefits are generous paid parental leave for new parents, on-site childcare centers at one location, paid leaves of absence to pursue further education with tuition covered, and on-site physicians, nurses, and health care. Other perks are gaming centers, organic gardens, eco-friendly furnishings, a pets-at-work policy, meditation and mindfulness training, and travel insurance and emergency assistance on personal and work-related travel. On the death of a Google employee, his or her spouse or domestic partner is compensated with a check for 50 percent of the employee&#8217;s salary each year for a decade. In addition, all a deceased employee&#8217;s stock options vest immediately for the surviving spouse or domestic partner. Furthermore, a deceased employee&#8217;s children receive $1000 per month until they reach the age of nineteen, or until the age of twenty-three if they are full-time students.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_rf-016" id="98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f-endNote19"><sup class="os-end-note-number">19</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm391337040">In addition to offering benefits and perks, managers can foster a healthy workplace by applying good &#8220;people skills&#8221; as well. Managers who are respectful, open, transparent, and approachable can achieve two goals simultaneously: a workforce that is happier and also one that is more productive. Good management requires constant awareness that each team member is also an individual working to meet both personal and company goals. Effective managers act on this by regularly meeting with employees to recognize strengths, identify constructive ways to improve on weaknesses, and help workers realize collective and individual goals. Ethical businesses and good managers also invest in efforts like performance management and employee training and development. These commitments call for giving employees frequent and honest feedback about what they do well and where they need improvement, thereby enabling them to develop the skills they need, not only to succeed in the current job but to move on to the next level. Fostering teamwork by treating people fairly and acknowledging their strengths is also an important responsibility of management. Ethical managers, therefore, demonstrate most, if not all, of the following qualities: cultural awareness, positive attitude, warmth and empathy, authenticity, emotional intelligence, patience, competence, accountability, respectful, and honesty.</p>

Findings of CFSI studies indicate that employee financial stress permeates the workplaces of virtually all industries and professions. This stress eats away at morale and affects business profits. A recent CFSI report details data showing that &#8220;85% of Americans are anxious about their personal financial situation, and admit that their anxiety interferes with work. Furthermore, this financial stress leads to productivity losses and increased absenteeism, healthcare claims, turnover and costs affecting workers who cannot afford to retire.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_rf-001" id="a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3-endNote20"><sup class="os-end-note-number">20</sup></a> The report also indicates that employees with high financial anxiety are twice as likely to take unnecessary sick time, which is can be expensive for an employer.</c:para>
<p id="auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_fs-idm204929456">The CFSI report makes clear that ensuring workers are paid a <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_term173" group-by="f">fair wage</span> is not only an ethical practice; it is also an effective way to achieve employees&#8217; highest and most productive level of performance, which is what every manager wants. In the process, it also makes workers more loyal to the company and less likely to jump ship at the first sign of a slightly better wage somewhere else.</p>
<p id="auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_fs-idm215971296">The concept of a fair wage has a greater significance than simply one worker&#8217;s pay or one company&#8217;s policy. It is an economic concept critical to the nation as a whole in an economic system like capitalism, in which individuals pay for most of what they need in life rather than receiving government benefits funded by taxes. The ethical issues for the business community and for society at large are to identify democratic systems that can effectively eradicate the financial suffering of the poorest citizens and to generate sufficient wages to support the economic sustainability of all workers in the United States. Put another way, has the real income of average American workers declined so much over the past few decades that it now threatens the productivity of the largest economy in the world?</p>

<p id="auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_fs-idm182204624">No reasonable person, regardless of profession or political party, would dispute that employees are entitled to a fair or just wage. Rather, it is in the <em data-effect="italics">calculation</em> of a fair wage that the debate begins. Economists, sociologists, psychologists, and politicians all have opinions about this, as have most workers. Some of the factors that feature in calculations are federal and state minimum-wage standards, the cost of living, and the rate of inflation. Should a fair wage include enough money to raise a family, too, if the wage earner is the sole or principal support of a family?</p>

Compare the twenty-year period of 1949 through 1968 with the fifty-year period from 1968 through 2017. The difference has created a sobering reality for many workers. In the nearly six decades since 1960, the inflation-adjusted real <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_term174" group-by="m">minimum wage</span> actually declined by 23 percent. That means minimum-wage workers did not even break even; the value of their wages declined over fifty years, meaning they have effectively worked half a century with no raise. In the following chart, <em data-effect="italics">nominal wage</em> represents the actual amount of money a worker earns per hour; <em data-effect="italics">real wage</em> represents the nominal wage adjusted for inflation.

States with the highest minimum hourly wages are Washington ($11.50), California and Massachusetts ($11.00), Arizona and Vermont ($10.50), New York and Colorado ($10.40), and Connecticut ($10.00). Some cities have even higher minimum hourly wages than under state law; for example, San Francisco and Seattle are at $15.00.

<p id="auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_fs-idm217568752">Equal pay under the law means equal pay for the &#8220;same&#8221; job, but not for the &#8220;equivalent&#8221; job. Those companies wishing to avoid strict compliance with the law may use several devices to justify unequal pay, including using slightly different job titles, slightly different lists of job duties, and other techniques that lead to different pay for different employees doing essentially the same job. Women have taken employers to court for decades, only to find their lawsuits unsuccessful because proving individual compensation discrimination is very difficult, especially given that multiple factors can come into play in compensation decisions. Sometimes class-action lawsuits have been more successful, but even then plaintiffs often lose.</p>

Researchers at Temple University and George Mason University found that if a new hire gets $5000 more than another worker hired at the same time, the difference is significantly magnified over time. Assuming an average annual pay increase of 5 percent, an employee starting with a $55,000 salary will earn at least $600,000 more over a forty-year career than an employee who starts an equivalent job with a $50,000 salary. This significantly affects many personal decisions, including retirement, because, all other things equal, a lower-paid woman will have to work three years longer than a man to earn the same amount of money over the course of her career.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_rf-010" id="a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3-endNote29"><sup class="os-end-note-number">29</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_fs-idm209388544">Whether we are discussing fair wages, minimum wages, or equal wages, the essence of the debate often boils down to ethics. What should people get paid, who should determine that, and should managers and upper management do only what is required by law or go above and beyond if that means doing what they think is right? Organizational pay structures are set by a variety of methods, including internal policies, the advice of outside compensation consultants, and external data, such as market salaries.</p>
<p id="auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_fs-idm197692304">An innovative compensation decision in Seattle may provide some insight. In 2011, a young man earning $35,000 a year told his boss at Gravity, a credit-card payments business, that his earnings were not sufficient for a decent life in expensive Seattle. The boss, Dan Price, who cofounded the company in 2004, was somewhat surprised as he had always taken pride in treating employees well. Nevertheless, he decided his employee was right. For the next three years, Gravity gave every employee a 20 percent annual raise. Still, profit continued to outgrow wages. So Price announced that over the <em data-effect="italics">next</em> three years, Gravity would phase in a minimum salary of $70,000 for all employees. He reduced his own salary from $1 million to $70,000, to demonstrate the point and help fund it. The following week, five thousand people applied for jobs at Gravity, including a Yahoo executive who took a pay cut to transfer to a company she considered fun and meaningful to work for.</p>
<p id="auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_fs-idm197690336">Price&#8217;s decision started a national debate: How much should people be paid? Since 2000, U.S. productivity has increased 22 percent, yet inflation-adjusted median wages have increased only 2 percent. That means a larger share of capitalism&#8217;s rewards are going to shareholders and top executives (who already earn an average of three hundred times more than typical workers, up from seventy times more just a decade ago), and a smaller share is going to workers. If Gravity profits while sharing the benefits of capitalism more broadly, Price&#8217;s actions will be seen as demonstrating that underpaying the workforce hurts employers. If it fails, it may look like proof that companies should not overpay.</p>

He calls the $70,000 minimum wage an ethical and moral imperative rather than a business strategy, and, though it will cost Gravity about $2 million per year, he has ruled out price increases and layoffs. More than half the initial cost was offset by his own pay cut, the rest by profit. Revenue continues to grow at Gravity, along with the customer base and the workforce. Currently, the firm has a retention rate of 91 percent.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_rf-018" id="a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3-endNote37"><sup class="os-end-note-number">37</sup></a> Yet Price says managers&#8217; scorecards should measure purpose, impact, and service, as much as profit.</c:para>

<p id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_fs-idm258075728">The issue of worker representation in the United States is a century-old debate, with economic, ethical, and political aspects. Are unions good for workers, good for companies, good for the nation? There is no single correct response. Your answer depends upon your perspective&#8212;whether you are a worker, a manager, an executive, a shareholder, or an economist. How might an ethical leader address the issue of the gap between labor&#8217;s productivity gains and their relatively stagnant wages as compared with that of management?</p>

<p id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_fs-idm246910432">Americans&#8217; longstanding belief in individualism makes some managers wonder why employees would want or need to be represented by a <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_term177" group-by="l">labor union</span>. The answer is, for the same reasons a CEO wants to be represented by an attorney when negotiating an employment contract, or that an entertainer wants to be represented by an agent. Unions act as the agent/lawyer/negotiator for employees during <span data-type="term" id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_term178" group-by="c">collective bargaining</span>, a negotiation process aimed at getting management&#8217;s agreement to a fair employment contract for members of the union. Everyone wants to be successful in any important negotiation, and people often turn to professionals to help them in such a situation.</p>
<p id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_fs-idm255576976">However, in the United States, as elsewhere around the globe, the concept of worker organization has been about more than simply good representation.

<p id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_fs-idm253293680">The value of unions is a topic that produces significant disagreement. Historically, unions have attained many improvements for workers in terms of wages and benefits, standardized employment practices, labor protections (e.g., child labor laws), workplace environment, and on-the-job safety. Nevertheless, sometimes unions have acted in their own interests to sustain their own existence, without primary concern for the workers they represent.</p>
<p id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_fs-idm261380128">The history of the worker movement (summarized in the video in the following <a href="#auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_fs-idm248529280">Link to Learning</a>) reveals that in the first half of the twentieth century, wages were abysmally low, few workplace safety laws existed, and exploitive working conditions allowed businesses to use child labor. Unions stepped in and played an important role in leveling the playing field by representing the interests of the workers. Union membership grew to a relatively high level (33% of wage and salary workers) in the 1950s, and unions became a force in politics. However, their dominance was relatively short-lived, not least because in the 1960s, the federal government started to enact employment laws that codified many of the worker protections unions had championed. In the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. economy gradually evolved from manufacturing, where unions were strong, to services, where unions were not as prevalent. The service sector is more difficult to organize, due to a variety of factors such as the historical absence of unions in the sector, workers&#8217; widely differing work functions and schedules, challenging organizational status, and white-collar bias against unions.</p>

<p id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_fs-idm253543328">These developments, along with the appearance of state right-to-work laws, have led to a decline in unions and their membership. <span data-type="term" id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_term179" group-by="R">Right-to-work laws</span> give workers the option of not joining the union, even at companies where the majority has voted to be represented by a union, resulting in lower membership. Right-to-work laws attempt to counter the concept of a union shop or <span data-type="term" id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_term180" group-by="c">closed shop</span>, which requires that all new hires automatically be enrolled in the labor union appropriate to their job function and that union dues automatically be deducted from their pay.</p>
<p id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_fs-idm246074528">Some question the fairness of right-to-work laws, because they allow those who do not join the union to get the same pay and benefits as those who do join and who pay unions dues for their representation. On the other hand, right-to-work laws provide workers the right of choice; those who do not want to join a union are not forced to do so. Those who do not choose to join may end up having a strained relationship with union workers, however, when a union-mandated strike occurs. Some non-union members, and even union members, elect to cross the picket line and continue to work. Traditionally, these &#8220;scabs,&#8221; as they are derisively labeled by unions, have faced both overt and subtle retaliation at the hands of their coworkers, who prioritize loyalty to the union.</p>
<p id="auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_fs-idm248407392">Twenty-eight states have right-to-work laws (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_OSX_Ethics_06_04_RightWork">Figure 6.10</a>).

For example, in Germany, workers, managers, and the public at large support the system, and it has often resulted in workers who are more engaged and have a real voice in their workplaces. Management and labor have cooperated, which, in turn, has led to higher productivity, fewer strikes, better pay, and safer working conditions for employees, which is a classic win-win for both sides.</p>

Instead, they are a relative bargain for most companies. <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_4d563807-767b-4723-ae27-e8bd73058860_OSX_Ethics_06_04_WagesProd">Figure 6.12</a> compares productivity and pay and demonstrates the growing disparity between the two, based on data collected by the Economic Policy Institute.</p>

Are CEOs in the United States that much better than CEOs in Germany or Japan? Do American companies perform that much better? Is this ratio fair to investors and employees? A large part of executive compensation is in the form of stock options, which frequently are included in the calculation of an executive&#8217;s salary and benefits, rather than direct salary. However, this, in turn, raises the question of whether all or a portion of the general workforce should also share in some form of stock options.</c:para>

Whether CEO or administrative assistant, engineer or assembly-line worker, we naturally look out for our own best interest. Thus, management compensation is a topic that often causes resentment among the rank and file, especially when organized workers go on strike. From the employee viewpoint, the question is why management often wants to hold the line when it comes to everyone&#8217;s wages but their own.</p>

The strike was eventually settled, with workers getting a raise, but bitter feelings and distrust remained on both sides. Workers thought management salaries were too high; management thought workers were seeking excessive raises. To continue basic phone services for its customers during the strike, Verizon called on thousands of non-union employees to perform the strikers&#8217; work. Non-union staff had to cross picket lines formed by fellow employees to go to work each day during the strike. Enmity toward these picket-line crossers was exceptionally high among some union members.</p>

They seek to minimize these risks, and that often requires monitoring employees at work. Employers might also be concerned about the productivity loss resulting from employees using office technology for personal matters while on the job. At the same time, however, organizations must balance the valid business interests of the company with employees&#8217; reasonable expectations of privacy.</p>

The two primary areas of the law related to workplace monitoring are a federal statute called the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_term185" group-by="E">Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986</span> (ECPA) and various state common law protections against invasion of privacy.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_rf-002" id="7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d-endNote50"><sup class="os-end-note-number">50</sup></a></c:para>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_79097">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm383795824">Although the ECPA may appear to prohibit an employer from monitoring its employees&#8217; oral, wire, and electronic communications, it contains two big exceptions that weaken its protection of employees&#8217; rights. One is the <span data-type="term" id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_term186" group-by="b">business purpose exception</span>. This allows employers&#8212;on the basis of legitimate business purposes&#8212;to monitor electronic and oral communications, and employers generally assert a legitimate business purpose to be present. The other widely used exception is the <span data-type="term" id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_term187" group-by="c">consent exception</span>, which allows employers to monitor employee communications provided employees have given their consent. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, the ECPA definition of electronic communication applies to the electronic transmission of communications but not to their electronic storage. Therefore, courts have distinguished between monitoring electronic communications such as e-mail during transmission and viewing e-mails in storage. Viewing emails during transmission is broadly allowed, whereas viewing stored e-mail is considered similar to searching an employee&#8217;s private papers and thus is not routinely allowed under the ECPA unless certain circumstances apply (e.g., the e-mails are stored in the employer&#8217;s computer systems).<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_rf-003" id="7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d-endNote51"><sup class="os-end-note-number">51</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm395589952">In general, it is legal for a company to monitor the use of its own property, including but not limited to computers, laptops, and cell phones. According to the ECPA, an employer-provided computer system is the property of the employer, and when the employer provides employees with a laptop they can take home, it likely violates no laws when it monitors everything employees do with that computer, whether business-related or personal. The same is true of an employer-provided cell phone or tablet, and always true when an employer gives employees notice of a written policy regarding electronic monitoring of equipment supplied by the company. Generally, the same is <em data-effect="italics">not</em> true of equipment owned by the employee, such as a personal cell phone.</p>
<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm391931312">However, an important distinction is based on the issue of consent. The consent provision in the ECPA is not limited to business communications only; therefore, a company might be able to assert the right to monitor personal electronic communications if it can show employee consent (although this is very likely to worry employees, as discussed in the next section). Another consideration is whose e-mail server is being used. The ECPA and some state laws generally make it illegal for employers to intercept private e-mail by using an employee&#8217;s personal log-on/user ID/password information.</p>
<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm383525136">Although the ECPA and National Labor Relations Act are both federal laws, individual states are free to pass laws that impose greater limitations, and several states have done so. Some require employers to provide employees advance written notice that specifies the types or methods of monitoring to which they will be subjected. Examples of state laws creating some degree of protection for workers include laws in California and Pennsylvania that require consent of both parties before any conversation can be monitored or recorded.</p>
<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm386369808">Employees can bring common law privacy claims to challenge employer monitoring. (Common laws are those based on prior court decisions rather than on legislatively enacted statutes.) To prevail on a common law claim of invasion of privacy, which is a tort, the employee must demonstrate a right to privacy with respect to the information being monitored. Several state constitutions, such as those in Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina, and California, expressly provide citizens a right to privacy, which may protect employees with respect to monitoring of their personal electronic information and personal communication in the workplace.</p>
<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm382023232">One additional regulatory consideration applicable to electronic monitoring is whether the company&#8217;s workforce is unionized. The National Labor Relations Board, the federal labor law agency, has ruled that the video surveillance of any portion of the workplace is a condition of employment subject to collective bargaining and must be agreed to by the union before implementation, so employees have notice. If a workplace is not unionized (the majority are not), then this federal regulation requiring notice does not apply, and as stated previously in this chapter, if there is any protection at all, it would have to be given by state regulation (which is rare in the private [nongovernmental] sector).</p>

<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm381890848">Many employees generally are not be familiar with the specific details of the law. They may feel offended by <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_term188" group-by="m">monitoring</span>, especially of their own equipment. Companies must also consider the effect on workplace morale if everyone feels spied upon, and the risk that some high-performing employees may decide to look elsewhere for career opportunities. Employers should develop a clear, specific, and reasonable monitoring policy. The policy should limit monitoring to that which is directly work related. For example, if a company is concerned about productivity and the goal of monitoring is to keep tabs on employee performance, then neither keystroke logging nor screenshot recording is necessary; software designed to show idle time or personal Internet use would be more helpful in identifying wasted time, which is the ultimate goal.</p>
<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm383643328">Employers should always remember their business goals when monitoring employees. It is not only a matter of treating employees ethically; it also makes good business sense to ensure that monitoring pertains only to business matters and does not unnecessarily intrude into the privacy of employees. Perhaps most importantly, in the interest of fairness, the monitoring policy must be communicated to the employees. When, if ever, is it acceptable to monitor without notice to the employee and without his or her knowledge?</p>

However, many states have policies that apply only to employees who work for the government. State employees hold a special status that conveys certain state constitutional rights with regard to due process, reasonable searches, and related legal doctrines. The same is true for federal government employees and the U.S. Constitution, which means the government has a duty of fairness in employee surveillance. It does not mean, however, that the government cannot monitor its employees at all, as demonstrated by an incident involving a California police officer. In a unanimous decision in <em data-effect="italics">Ontario v. Quon</em>,<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_rf-004" id="7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d-endNote52"><sup class="os-end-note-number">52</sup></a> the U.S. Supreme Court in 2010 ruled in favor of a police chief in Ontario, California, who read nearly five hundred text messages sent by one of his sergeants on a police-issued pager. Many of the text messages were personal and some were sexually explicit. Only a few dozen were work related. The justices agreed that constitutional limits on unreasonable searches by public employers (under the Fourth Amendment) were minimal given a work-related purpose.</c:para>
<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm391900896">This decision creates precedent for more than 25 million employees of federal, state, and local governments and limits their expectation of privacy when using employer-issued tools. &#8220;Because the search [by the police chief] was motivated by a legitimate work-related purpose and because it was not excessive in scope, the search was reasonable,&#8221; said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.</p>
<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm393095808">In the private sector, where employees are not working for the government and the constitutional prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures has very little applicability, if any, employers have even more latitude in terms of employee monitoring than in a government setting. The <em data-effect="italics">Ontario v. Quon</em> case in all likelihood would never even make it to court if the employer were a private-sector company, because the issue of whether getting the text message was a reasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment does not apply in a nongovernment employment setting. The Constitution acts to limit government intrusions but does not generally restrict private companies in this type of situation. However, ethical considerations may encourage private-sector employers to treat their workers respectfully, even if not required by law.</p>

<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm395049680">Key issues that arise about a <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_term189" group-by="d">drug testing</span> or monitoring program begin with whether an employer wants or needs to do it. Is it required by law for a particular job, under state or local regulations? Is it for pre-employment clearance? Does the employer need employees&#8217; permission? Does a failed test require mandatory termination? With the exception of employers in industries regulated by the federal government, such as airlines, trucking companies, rail lines, and national security-related firms, federal law is not controlling on the issue of drug testing in the workplace; it is largely a state issue. At the federal level, the Department of Transportation does mandate drug testing for workers such as airline crews and railway conductors and has a specific procedure that must be followed. However, for the most part, drug testing is not mandatory and depends on whether the employer wants to do it. Multiple states do regulate drug testing, but to varying degrees, and there is no common standard to be followed.</p>
<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm379831760">Testing of job applicants is the most common form of drug testing. State laws typically allow it, but the employer must follow state rules, if they exist, about providing notice and following standard procedures intended to prevent inaccurate samples. Testing current employees is much less common, primarily due to cost; however, companies that do use drug testing include some in the pharmaceutical and financial services industries. Some states put legal constraints on drug testing of private-sector employees. For example, in a few states. the job must include the possibility of property damage or injury to others, or the employer must believe the employee is using drugs.</p>
<p id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_fs-idm386128256">Challenging a drug test is difficult because tests are considered highly accurate. An applicant or employee can refuse to take the test, but that often means not being hired or losing the job, assuming the worker is an employee at will. The concept of <span data-type="term" id="auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_term190" group-by="e">employment at will</span> affirms that either the employee or the employer may dissolve an employment arrangement at will (i.e., without cause and at any time unless an employment contract is in effect that stipulates differently). Most workers are considered employees at will because neither the employer nor employee is obligated to the other; the worker can quit or be fired at any time for any reason because there is no contractual obligation. In some states, the employee risks not only job loss but also the denial of unemployment benefits if fired for refusing to take a drug test. Thus, the key concept that makes drug testing possible is employment at will, which covers approximately 85 percent of the employees in the private sector (unionized workers and top executives have contracts and thus are not at will, nor are government employees who have due process rights). The only legal limitation is that, in some states, the drug testing procedure must be fair, accurate, and designed to minimize errors and false-positive results.</p>

Employers want and are allowed to protect against specimen tampering by taking such steps as requiring subjects to wear a hospital gown. Some employers use test monitors who check the temperature of the urine and/or listen as a urine sample is collected. According to the Cornell University Law School Legal Information Institute, some state courts (e.g., Georgia, Louisiana, Hawaii) have found it an unreasonable invasion of privacy for the monitor to watch an employee in the restroom; however, in other states (e.g., Texas, Nevada), this is allowed.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d_rf-005" id="7bce66b5-69ff-437e-bb0c-3d051f46089d-endNote53"><sup class="os-end-note-number">53</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_98282ea6-56e5-4dfc-947f-b3068b418c8f_fs-idm386414496">A company and its managers need to provide a workplace at which employees want to work, free of safety hazards and all types of harassment. Perks and benefits also make the company an attractive place to work. Yet another factor is managers who make employees feel valued and respected. A company can use all these tools to attract and retain top talent, helping to reach the goals of having a well-run company with a satisfied workforce. Philosophers Aristotle and Immanuel Kant said taking ethical action is the right thing to do. The decision to create an environment in which employees want to come to work each day is, in large part, an ethical choice, because it creates a healthy environment for all to encounter. However, the bonus comes when a satisfied workforce fosters increased quality and productivity, which leads to appreciative customers or clients and increased profitability. There is a financial payoff in that a well-treated workforce is also a productive one.</p>

<p id="auto_a3fb3fa1-21a6-4d11-a68d-5b3530ccaab3_fs-idm223739072">The concept of paying people fairly can become complicated. It includes trying to allocate and compensate workers in the most effective manner for the company, but it takes judgement, wisdom, and a moral imperative to do it fairly. Managers must balance issues of compensation equity, employee morale, motivation, and profits&#8212;all of which may have legal, ethical, and business elements. The issue of a fair wage is particularly salient for those earning the minimum wage, which, in real terms, has declined by 23 percent since 1960, and for women, who continue to experience a significant pay gap as compared with their male counterparts.</p>

Union membership in the United States has fallen in recent years as federal and state law have expanded to include worker protections unions fought for, and as the nation has shifted from a manufacturing to a service economy. Public-sector employee groups such as teachers, professors, first responders, and nurses are unionized in some cities and states. U.S. workers have contributed to a long rise in productivity over the last forty years but have not generally shared in wage gains.</p>

This chapter looks at the other side of that relationship to weigh the ethical dimensions of being a worthy employee and responsible coworker (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_cc074c0b-0213-46af-8760-c4a57a887a2d_OSX_Ethics_07_00_Employees">Figure 7.1</a>).</p>



<p id="auto_cc074c0b-0213-46af-8760-c4a57a887a2d_fs-idm341400112">Coworkers may express their opinions differently, for instance, agreeing or disagreeing, perhaps in very animated ways. Although we and our peers at work may not see eye to eye on every issue, we work best when we understand the need to get along and to show a degree of loyalty to our employer and each other, as well as to ourselves, our values, and our own best interests. Balancing these factors requires a concerted effort.</p>



<p id="auto_cc074c0b-0213-46af-8760-c4a57a887a2d_fs-idm350770288">What would you do, for example, if one of your coworkers were being bullied or harassed by another employee or a manager? Suppose a former colleague tried to recruit you to her new firm. What is the ethical action for you to take? How would you react if you learned your company&#8217;s managers were behaving unethically or breaking the law? Who could you tell, and what could you expect as a result? What is the right response if a client or customer behaves badly toward you as an employee representing your firm? How do you provide good customer service and support the company brand in the face of difficult working conditions?</p>

<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm228555648">The relationship between employee and employer is changing, especially our understanding of commitment and loyalty. An ethical employee owes the company a good day&#8217;s work and his or her best effort, whether the work is stimulating or dull. A duty of loyalty and our best effort are our primary obligations as employees, but what they mean can change. A manager who expects a twentieth-century concept of loyalty in the twenty-first century may be surprised when workers express a sense of entitlement, ask for a raise after six months, or leave for a new job after twelve months. This chapter will explore a wide range of issues from the perspective of what and how employees contribute to the overall success of a business enterprise.</p>

<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm224961344">Hard work and our best effort likely make sense as obligations we owe an employer. However, <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_term191" group-by="l">loyalty</span> is more abstract and less easily defined. Most workers do not have employment contracts, so there may not be a specific agreement between the two parties detailing their mutual responsibilities. Instead, the common law (case law) of agency in each state is often the source of the rules governing an employment relationship. The usual depiction of duty in common law is the <span data-type="term" id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_term192" group-by="d">duty of loyalty</span>, which, in all fifty states, requires that an employee refrain from acting in a manner contrary to the employer&#8217;s interest. This duty creates some basic rules employees must follow on the job and provides employers with enforceable rights against employees who violate them.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_64095">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm248641056">In general terms, the duty of loyalty means an employee is obligated to render &#8220;loyal and faithful&#8221; service to the employer, to act with &#8220;good faith,&#8221; and not to compete with but rather to advance the employer&#8217;s interests.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_rf-001" id="b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0-endNote1"><sup class="os-end-note-number">1</sup></a> The employee must not act in a way that benefits him- or herself (or any other third party), especially when doing so would create a conflict of interest with the employer.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_rf-002" id="b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0-endNote2"><sup class="os-end-note-number">2</sup></a> The common law of most states holds as a general rule that, without asking for and receiving the employer&#8217;s consent, an employee cannot hold a second job if it would compete or conflict with the first job. Thus, although the precise boundaries of this aspect of the duty of loyalty are unclear, an employee who works in the graphic design department of a large advertising agency in all likelihood cannot moonlight on the weekend for a friend&#8217;s small web design business. However, employers often grant permission for employees to work in positions that do not compete or interfere with their principal jobs. The graphic designer might work for a friend&#8217;s catering business, for example, or perhaps as a wedding photographer or editor of a blog for a public interest community group.</c:para>

<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm247814048">What <em data-effect="italics">is</em> clear is that it is wrong for employees to make work decisions primarily for their own personal gain, rather than doing what is in the employer&#8217;s best interest. An employee might have the authority to decide which other companies the employer will do business with, for example, such as service vendors that maintain the copiers or clean the offices. What if the employee owned stock in one of those companies or had a relative who worked there? That gives him or her an incentive to encourage doing business with that particular company, whether it would be best for the employer or not.</p>
<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm248910576">The degree to which the duty of loyalty exists is usually related to the degree of responsibility or trust an employer places in an employee. More trust equals a stronger duty. For example, when an employee has very extensive authority or access to confidential information, the duty can rise to its highest level, called a fiduciary duty, which is discussed in an earlier chapter.</p>

<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm247048128">Why are employees less likely to feel a duty of loyalty to their companies? One reason is that loyalty is a two-way street, a feeling developed through the enactment of mutual obligations and responsibilities. However, most employers do not want to be obligated to their workers in a legal sense; they usually require that almost all workers are employees &#8220;at will,&#8221; that is, without any long-term employment contract. Neither state nor federal law mandates an employment contract, so when a company says an employee is employed at will, it is sending a message that management is not making a long-term commitment to the employee. Employees may naturally feel less loyalty to an organization from which they believe they can be let go at any time and for any legal reason (which is essentially what at-will employment means). Of course, at-will employment also means the employee can also quit at any time. However, freedom to move is a benefit only if the employee has mobility and a skill set he or she can sell to the highest bidder. Otherwise, for most workers, at-will employment usually works to the employer&#8217;s advantage, not the employee&#8217;s.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_65567">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm263990128">Another reason the concept of loyalty to an organization seems to be changing at all levels is the important role money plays in career decisions. When they see chief executive officers (CEOs) and other managers leaving to work for the highest bidder, subordinates quickly conclude that they, too, ought to look out for themselves, just as their bosses do, rather than trying to build up seniority with the company. Switching jobs can often be a way for employees to improve their salaries. Consider professional sports. For decades professional athletes were tied to one team and could not sell their services to the highest bidder, meaning that their salaries were effectively capped. Finally, after several court decisions (including the Curt Flood reserve clause case involving the St. Louis Cardinals and Major League Baseball),<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_rf-006" id="b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0-endNote6"><sup class="os-end-note-number">6</sup></a> players achieved some degree of freedom and can now switch employers frequently in an effort to maximize their earning potential.</c:para>
<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm250363600">The same evolution occurred in the entertainment industry. In the early years of the movie business, actors were tied to studios by contracts that prevented them from making movies for any other studio, effectively limiting their earning power. Then the entertainment industry changed as actors gained the freedom to sell their services to the highest bidder, becoming much more highly compensated in the process. Employees in any industry, not just sports and entertainment, benefit from being able to change jobs if their salary at their current job stagnates or falls below the market rate.</p>
<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm260522288">Another economic phenomenon affecting loyalty in the private sector was the switch from defined-benefit to <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_term194" group-by="d">defined-contribution retirement plans</span>. In the former, often called a pension, employee benefits are usually sponsored (paid) fully by the employer and calculated using a formula based on length of employment, salary history, and other factors. The employer administers the plan and manages the investment risk, promising the employee a set payout upon retirement. In the defined-contribution plan, however, the employee invests a certain percentage of his or her salary in a retirement fund, often a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, where it is sometimes matched (partially or wholly) by the employer. (These savings plans with their seemingly strange designations are part of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and the letter/number combinations indicate subsections of the Code. 401(k) Plans typically are featured in for-profit employment settings and 403(b) plans in nonprofit environments.) Defined-benefit plans reward longevity in the firm, whereas defined-contribution plans reward high earnings over seniority. Thus, with the growth of defined-contribution plans, some reasons for staying with the same employer over time are no longer applicable.</p>

However, it is a mistake for managers to think money is not a central factor influencing employees&#8217; job satisfaction. Money matters because if employees are not making enough money to meet their financial obligations or goals, they will likely be looking to for a higher-paying job. And, of course, increasing salary or other benefits can be a way of demonstrating both the company&#8217;s loyalty to its employees and the role it believes employees&#8217; best interests play in its mission&#8212;navigating the aforementioned two-way street. For some employees, simply being acknowledged and thanked for their service and good work can go a long way toward sparking their loyalty; for others, more concrete rewards may be necessary.</c:para>
<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm258106048">Finally, many people work for themselves as freelance or contract workers in the new &#8220;gig&#8221; economy. They may take assignments from one or more companies at a time and are not employees in the traditional sense of the word. Therefore, it seems more reasonable that they would approach work in the same way a certified public accountant or attorney would&#8212;as completing a professional job for a client, after which they move on the next client, always keeping their independent status. We would not expect gig workers to demonstrate employer loyalty when they are not employees.</p>

Some companies focus on team-building activities, company picnics, rock-climbing walls, or zip lines, but do these actually make workers decide to stay with their company for less salary? The answer is usually no. The reality is that salary plays an important role in an employee&#8217;s decision to move to a new job. Therefore, retention bonuses are a popular and perhaps more successful technique for instilling loyalty. The company provides a payment to an employee contingent on his or her committing to remain at the company for a specific period.</p>

<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm265941104">In the competitive world of business, many employees encounter information in their day-to-day work that their employers reasonably expect they will keep confidential. Proprietary (private) information, the details of patents and copyrights, employee records and salary histories, and customer-related data are valued company assets that must remain in-house, not in the hands of competitors, trade publications, or the news media. Employers are well within their rights to expect employees to honor their <span data-type="term" id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_term195" group-by="d">duty of confidentiality</span> and maintain the secrecy of such proprietary material. Sometimes the duty of <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_term196" group-by="c">confidentiality</span> originates specifically from an employment contract, if there is one, and if not, the duty still exists in most situations under the common law of agency.</p>
<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm253949504">Most companies do not consider U.S. common law on confidentiality sufficient protection, so they often adopt employment agreements or contracts with employees that set forth the conditions of confidentiality. (Note that such contracts define a one-way obligation, from the employee to the employer, so they do not protect the at-will employee from being terminated without cause.) Typically, an employment agreement will list a variety of requirements. For example, although in most situations the law would already hold that the employer owns copyrightable works created by employees within the scope of their employment (known as <em data-effect="italics">works for hire</em>), a contract usually also contains a specific clause stating that the company owns any and all such works and assigning ownership of them to the company. The agreement will also contain a patent assignment provision, stating that all inventions created within the scope of employment are owned by or assigned to the company.</p>

When a company&#8217;s products or services are legitimate and safe and its employment policies are fair and compassionate, managers should be able to rely on their employees&#8217; dedication to those products or services and to their customers. Although no employee should be called upon to lie or cover up a misstep on the part of the firm, every employee should be willing to make a sincere commitment to an ethical employer.</p>

Consider these examples in the fast-food industry. A photo posted on Taco Bell&#8217;s Facebook page showed an employee licking a row of tacos. A Domino&#8217;s Pizza employee can be seen in a YouTube video spitting on food, putting cheese into his nose and then putting that cheese into a sandwich, and rubbing a sponge used for dishwashing on his groin area.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c_rf-003" id="a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c-endNote17"><sup class="os-end-note-number">17</sup></a> On Twitter, a Burger King employee in Japan posted a photo of himself lying on hamburger buns while on duty.</c:para>
<p id="auto_a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c_fs-idm263814720">The companies all responded swiftly. A Taco Bell spokesperson said the food was not served to customers and the employee in the photo was fired. The two Domino&#8217;s employees behind the videos were fired and faced felony charges and a civil lawsuit; Domino&#8217;s said the tainted food was never delivered. According to a Burger King news release, the buns in the photo were waste material because of an ordering mistake and were promptly discarded after the photo was taken; the employee in the photo was fired.</p>
<p id="auto_a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c_fs-idm249803504">These examples demonstrate how much damage disloyal or disgruntled employees can create, especially on social media. All three companies experienced financial and goodwill losses after the incidents and struggled to restore public trust in their products. The immediate and long-term costs of such incidents are the reason companies invest in developing brand loyalty among their employees.</p>

Of course, some employees may not want to be the equivalent of a company spokesperson. Is it reasonable to expect an employee to be a kind of roving ambassador for the company, even when off the clock and interacting with friends and neighbors? Suppose employers offer employees substantial discounts on their products or services. Is this an equitable way to sustain reciprocal loyalty between managers and workers? Why or why not?</c:para>
<p id="auto_a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c_fs-idm251087840">Internal marketing is an important part of the solution to the problem of employees who act as if they do not care about the company. It helps employees make a personal connection to the products and services the business sells, without which they might be more likely to undermine the company&#8217;s expectations, as in the three fast-food examples cited in this section. In those cases, it is clear the employees did not believe in the brand and felt hostile toward the company. The most common problem is usually not as extreme. More often it is a lack of effort or &#8220;slacking&#8221; on the job. Employees are more likely to develop some degree of brand loyalty when they share a common sense of purpose and identity with the company.</p>

How well or poorly they do so contributes a great deal to customers&#8217; impression of the company. And customers&#8217; perceptions affect not only the company but all the employees who depend on its success for their livelihood. Thus, the ethical obligations of an employee also extend to interactions with customers, whom they should treat with respect. Employers can encourage positive behavior toward customers by empowering employees to use their best judgment when working with them.</p>

Kathy Fryman is one such employee. Fryman was a custodian for three decades at a one hundred-year-old school in the Augusta (KY) Independent School District. She was not just taking care of the school building, she was also taking care of the people inside.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c_rf-005" id="a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c-endNote19"><sup class="os-end-note-number">19</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c_fs-idm248409104">Fryman fixed doors that would not close, phones that would not ring, and alarms that did not sound when they should. She kept track of keys and swept up dirty floors before Parents&#8217; Night. That was all part of the job of custodian, but she did much more.</p>
<p id="auto_a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c_fs-idm263495184">Fryman would often ask the nurse how an ill student was doing. She would check with a teacher about a kid who was going through tough times at home. If a teacher mentioned needing something, the next day it would show up on his or her desk. A student who needed something for class would suddenly find it in his or her backpack. Speaking of Fryman, district superintendent Lisa McCrane said, &#8220;She just has a unique way of making others feel nurtured, comforted, and cared for.&#8221; According to Fryman, &#8220;I need to be doing something for somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p id="auto_a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c_fs-idm247194144">Fryman&#8217;s customers were not there to buy a product on which she would make a commission. Her customers were students and teachers, parents and taxpayers. Yet she provided the kind of service that all employers would be proud of, the kind that makes a difference to people every day.</p>
<p id="auto_a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c_fs-idm249769104"><strong data-effect="bold">Critical Thinking</strong></p>
<ul id="fs-idm250336848">
<li>Is there a way for a manager to find, develop, and encourage the next Fryman, or is the desire to &#8220;do something good for somebody&#8221; an inherent trait in some employees that is missing in others?</li>
<li>What is the appropriate means to reward a worker with Fryman&#8217;s level of commitment? Her salary was fixed by school district pay schedules. Should she have been given an extra stipend for service above and beyond the expected? Additional time off with pay? Some other reward?</li>
<li>Employees who display Fryman&#8217;s zeal often do so for their own internal rewards. Others may simply want to be recognized and appreciated for their effort.

Sometimes, however, customers are rude or disrespectful, creating a challenge for an employee who wants to do a good job. This problem is best addressed by management and the employee working together. In the Pizza Hut case that follows, an employee was placed in a bad situation by customers.</p>

<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm228593040">By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
<ul id="fs-idm246918464">
<li>Explain employees&#8217; responsibility to treat their peers with respect</li>
<li>Describe employees&#8217; duty to follow company policy and the code of conduct</li>
<li>Discuss types of workplace violence</li>
</ul>
<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm258952752">You may spend more time with your coworkers than you spend with anyone else, including your family and friends. Thus, your ability to get along with work colleagues can have a significant impact on your life, as well as your attitude toward your job and your employer. All sorts of personalities populate our workplaces, but regardless of their working style, preferences, or quirks, employees owe one another courtesy and respect. That does not mean always agreeing with them, because evaluating a diversity of perspectives on business problems and opportunities is often essential for finding solutions. At the same time, however, we are responsible for limiting our arguments to principles, not personalities. This is what we owe to one another as human beings, as well as to the firm, so worksite arguments do not inflict lasting harm on the people who work there or on the company itself.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm251243328"><h3 data-type="title">Getting Along with Coworkers</h3>
<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm258315456">An employee who gets along with coworkers can help the company perform better. What can employees do to help create a more harmonious workplace with a positive atmosphere?</p>
<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm247979424">One thing you can do is to keep an open mind. You may be wondering as you start a new job whether you will get along with your colleagues as well as you did at your old job. Or, if you did not get along with the people there and were looking for a change, you might fear things will be the same at the new job. Do not make any prejudgments. Get to know a bit about your new coworkers. Accept, or extend, lunch invitations, join weekend activities and office social events, and perhaps join those office traditions that bind long-serving employees and newcomers together in a collaborative spirit.</p>
<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm254143392">Another thing you can do it to remember to be kind. Everyone has a bad day every now and then, and if you spot a coworker having one, performing a random act of kindness may make that person&#8217;s day better. You do not need to be extravagant. Offer to stay late to help the person meet a tight deadline, or bring coffee or a healthy snack to someone working on particularly difficult tasks. Remember the adage, &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be important, but it&#8217;s more important to be nice.&#8221;</p>
<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm247771824">For any relationship to succeed, including the relationship between coworkers, the parties must respect each other&#8212;and show it. Avoid doing things that might offend others. For example, do not take credit for someone else&#8217;s work. Do not be narrow minded; when someone brings up a topic such as politics or religion, be willing to listen and tolerate differing points of view.</p>
<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm250134240">A related directive is to avoid sexual jokes, stories, anecdotes, and innuendos. You might think it is okay to talk about anything and everything at work, but it is not. Others may not find the topic funny and feel offended, and you may make yourself vulnerable to action by management if such behavior is reported. Your coworkers might be a captive audience, but you should never place them in an awkward position.</p>
<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm262697632">Make an effort to get along with everyone, even difficult people. You did not choose your coworkers, and some may be hard to get along with. But professionalism requires that we attempt to establish the best working relationships we can on the job, no matter the opinions we might have about our colleagues. Normally, we might like some of them very much, be neutral about some others, and genuinely dislike still others. Yet our responsibility in the workplace is to respect and act at least civilly toward all of them. We likely will feel better about ourselves as professionals and also live up to our commitments to our companies.</p>
<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm246611040">Finally, do no use social media to gossip. Gossiping at work can cause problems anywhere, perhaps especially on social media, so resist the urge to vent online about your coworkers. It makes you appear petty, small, and untrustworthy, and colleagues may stop communicating with you. You may also run afoul of your employer&#8217;s social media policy and risk disciplinary action or dismissal.</p>

<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm248653440">Understanding the various personalities at work can be a complex task, but it is a vital one for developing a sense of collegiality. One technique that may be helpful is to develop your own emotional intelligence, which is the capacity to recognize other people&#8217;s emotions and also to know and manage your own. One aspect of using emotional intelligence is showing empathy, the willingness to step into someone else&#8217;s shoes.</p>

Some of us gravitate toward independence and jobs or tasks we can accomplish alone. Others prefer team or project work, bringing us into touch with different personalities. Still others seek a mix of these environments. Some prioritize getting the job done as efficiently as possible, whereas others value the journey of working on the project with others and the shared experiences it brings. There is no right or wrong style, but it benefits any worker to know his or her preferences and something about the work personalities of colleagues. When in the office, the point for any of us individually is to appreciate what motivates our greatest success and happiness on the job.</p>

Still, you have to do your best to establish an atmosphere in which they can least collaborate civilly.

Employees, in fact, have a legal and ethical duty not to be violent at work, and managers have a duty to prevent or stop violence. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reports that violence at work usually fits into one of four categories: traditional criminal intent, violence by one worker against another, violence stemming from a personal relationship, and violence by a customer.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_rf-002" id="1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e-endNote22"><sup class="os-end-note-number">22</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm250580848">In violence based on traditional criminal intent, the perpetrator has no legitimate relationship to the business or its employees, and often the violence is part of a crime such as robbery or shoplifting. Violence between coworkers occurs when a current or former employee attacks another employee in the workplace. Worker-on-worker deaths account for approximately 15 percent of all workplace homicides. All companies are at risk for this type of violence, and contributing factors include failure to conduct a criminal background check as part of the hiring process.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_32082">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm227073536">When the violence arises from problems in a personal relationship, the perpetrator often has a direct relationship not with the business but with the victim, who is an employee. This category of violence accounts for slightly less than 10 percent of all workplace homicides. Women are at higher risk of being victims of this type of violence than men. In the fourth scenario, the violent person has a legitimate relationship with the business, perhaps as a customer or patient, and becomes violent while on the premises. A large portion of customer incidents occur in the nightclub, restaurant, and health care industries. In 2014, about one-fifth of all workplace homicides resulted from this type of violence.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_rf-003" id="1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e-endNote23"><sup class="os-end-note-number">23</sup></a></c:para>

Recent news stories have highlighted the hacking of electronic tools such as computers and databases, and employees and managers can indirectly contribute to such data breaches through unauthorized web surfing, sloppy e-mail usage, and other careless actions. Large companies such as Equifax, LinkedIn, Sony, Facebook, and JP Morgan Chase have suffered the theft of customer information, leading to loss of consumer confidence; sometimes large fines have been levied on companies. Employees play a part in preventing such breaches by strictly following company guidelines about data privacy and confidentiality, the use and storage of passwords, and other safeguards that limit access to only authorized users.</p>

A victim of sexual harassment can be a man or a woman, and/or the same sex as the harasser. The harasser can be a supervisor, coworker, other employee, officer/director, intern, consultant, or nonemployee. Whatever the situation, harassing and threatening behavior is wrong (and sometimes criminal) and should always be reported.</p>

<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm347414208">The buying or selling of stocks, bonds, or other investments based on nonpublic information that is likely to affect the price of the security being traded is called <span data-type="term" id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_term211" group-by="i">insider trading</span>. For example, someone who is privy to information that a company is about to be taken over, which will cause its stock price to rise when the information becomes public, may buy the stock before it goes up in order to sell it later for an enhanced profit. Likewise, someone with inside information about a coming drop in share price may sell all his or her holdings at the current price before the information is announced, avoiding the loss other shareholders will suffer when the price falls. Although insider trading can be difficult to prove, it is essentially cheating. It is illegal, unethical, and unfair, and it often injures other investors, as well as undermining public confidence in the stock market.</p>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm341955408">Insider trading laws are somewhat complex. They have developed through federal court interpretations of Section 10(b)5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as through actions by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The laws identify several kinds of violations. These include trading by an insider (generally someone who performs work for the company) who possesses significant confidential information relevant to the valuation of the company&#8217;s stock, and trading by someone outside of the company who is given this sort of information by an insider or who obtains it inappropriately. Even being the messenger (the one communicating material nonpublic information to others on behalf of someone else) can be a legal violation.</p>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm342833280">The concept of an &#8220;insider&#8221; is broad and includes officers, directors, and employees of a company issuing securities. A person can even constitute what is called a &#8220;temporary insider&#8221; if he or she temporarily assumes a unique confidential relationship with a firm and, in doing so, acquires confidential information centered on the firm&#8217;s financial and operational affairs. Temporary insiders can be investment bankers, brokers, attorneys, accountants, or other professionals typically thought of as outsiders, such as newspaper and television reporters.</p>

When the information was released to the public, the price of the stock went up and the employees sold their stock, making a significant amount of money. The SEC and the Department of Justice prosecuted the employees for insider trading and won a conviction; the employees had to give back all the money they had made on their trades. Insider trading cases are often highly publicized, especially when charges are brought against high-profile figures.</c:para>

Everyone wondered how; the answer was that he cheated. Boesky went to the source&#8212;the major investment banks&#8212;to get insider information. He paid Levine and Siegel to give him pretakeover details, an illegal action, and he profited enormously from nearly every major deal in the merger-crazy 1980s, including huge deals involving oil companies such as Texaco, Getty, Gulf, and Chevron.</c:para>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm343465392">The SEC started to become suspicious after receiving a tip that someone was leaking information. Investigators discovered Levine&#8217;s secret Swiss bank account, with all the money Boesky had paid him. Levine then gave up Boesky in a plea deal; the SEC started watching Boesky and subsequently caught Siegel and Milken.</p>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm356440192">The penalties were the most severe ever given at the time. Milken, the biggest catch of all, agreed to pay $200 million in government fines, $400 million to investors who had been hurt by his actions, and $500 million to DBL clients&#8212;for a grand total of $1.1 billion. He was sentenced to ten years in prison and banned for life from any involvement in the securities industry. Boesky received a prison sentence of 3.5 years, was fined $100 million, and was permanently barred from working with securities. Levine agreed to pay $11.5 million and $2 million more in back taxes; he too was given a lifetime ban and was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm345114640">Milken and Levine violated their financial duties to their employer and the company&#8217;s clients. Not only does insider trading create a public relations nightmare, it also subjects the company to legal liability. DBL ended up being held liable in civil lawsuits due to the actions of its employees, and it was also charged with violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act) and ultimately failed, going bankrupt in 1990.</p>

He resolutely advises others to avoid his criminal acts and has endowed some worthy causes in Los Angeles.)</p>

<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm356329136">Another temptation that may present itself to employees is the offer of a bribe. A <span data-type="term" id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_term212" group-by="b">bribe</span> is a payment in some material form (cash or noncash) for an act that runs counter to the legal or ethical culture of the work environment. Bribery constitutes a violation of the law in all fifty U.S. states, as well as of a federal law that prohibits bribery in international transactions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Bribery generally injures not only individuals but also competitors, the government, and the free-market system as a whole. Of course, often the bribe is somewhat less obvious than an envelope full of money. It is important, therefore, to understand what constitutes a bribe.</p>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm354015424">Numerous factors help establish the ethics (and legality) of gift giving and receiving: the value of the gift, its purpose, the circumstances under which it is given, the position of the person receiving it, company policy, and the law. Assuming an employee has decision-making authority, the company wants and has the right to expect him or her to make choices in <em data-effect="italics">its</em> best interest, not the employee&#8217;s own self-interest. For example, assume an employee has the authority to buy a copy machine for the company. The employer wants to get the best copy machine for the best price, taking into account quality, service, warranties, and other factors. But what if the employee accepts a valuable gift card from a vendor who sells a copy machine with higher operating and maintenance charges, and then places the order with that vendor. This is clearly not in the best interests of the employer. It constitutes a failure on the part of the employee to follow ethical and legal rules, and, in all likelihood, company policy as well. If a company wants its employees always to do the right thing, it must have policies and procedures that ensure the employees know what the rules are and the consequences for breaking them.</p>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm351853760">A gift may be only a well-intentioned token of appreciation, but the potential for violating company rules (and the law) is still present. A well-written and effectively communicated gift policy provides guidance to company employees about what is and is not appropriate to accept from a customer or vendor and when. This policy should clearly state whether employees are allowed to accept gifts on or outside the work premises and who may give or accept them. If gifts are allowed, the gift policy should define the acceptable value and type, and the circumstances under which an employee may accept a gift.</p>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm345886608">When in doubt about whether the size or value of a gift renders it impossible for an employee to accept it, workers should be advised to check with the appropriate officer or department within their company. Be it an &#8220;ethics hotline&#8221; or simply the human resources department, wise firms provide an easy protocol for employees to follow in determining what falls within and without the protocols for accepting gifts.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_49195">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm347173616">As an example of a gift policy, consider the federal government&#8217;s strict rules.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_rf-003" id="e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca-endNote27"><sup class="os-end-note-number">27</sup></a> A federal employee may not give or solicit a contribution for a gift to an official superior and may not accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay if that employee is a subordinate. On annual occasions when gifts are traditionally given, such as birthdays and holidays, an employee may give a superior a gift valued at less than $10. An employee may not solicit or accept a gift given because of his or her official position, or from a prohibited source, including anyone who has or seeks official action or business with the agency. In special circumstances such as holidays, and unless the frequency of the gifts would appear to be improper, an employee generally may accept gifts of less than $20. Gifts of entertainment, such as expensive restaurant meals, are also restricted. Finally, gifts must be reported when their total value from one source exceeds $390 in a calendar year. Some companies in the private sector follow similar rules.</c:para>

Although every company wants to land lucrative contracts around the world, most expect their employees to follow both the law and company policy when attempting to consummate such deals. The U.S. law prohibiting bribery in international business dealings is the <span data-type="term" id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_term213" group-by="F">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</span> (FCPA), which is an amendment to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, one of the most important laws promoting transparency in corporate governance. The FCPA dates to 1977 and was amended in 1988 and 1998. Its main purpose is to make it illegal for companies and their managers to influence or bribe foreign officials with monetary payments or rewards of any kind in an attempt to get or keep business opportunities outside the United States. The FCPA is enforced through the joint efforts of the SEC and the Department of Justice.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_rf-004" id="e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca-endNote28"><sup class="os-end-note-number">28</sup></a> It applies to any act by U.S. businesses, their representatives, foreign corporations whose stock is traded in U.S. markets, and all U.S. citizens, nationals, or residents acting in furtherance of a foreign corrupt practice, whether they are physically present in the United States or not (this is called the nationality principle). Antibribery law is a serious issue for companies with overseas business and cross-border sales. Any companies or individuals convicted of these activities may pay significant fines, and individuals can face prison time.</c:para>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm341486752">The FCPA prohibits an agent of any company incorporated in the United States from extending a bribe to a foreign government official to achieve a business advantage in that country, but it does not specifically prohibit the extension of a bribe to a private officer of a nongovernmental company in a foreign country. The definition of a foreign government official can be expansive; it includes not only those working directly for the government but also company officials if the company is owned or operated by the government. An exception is made for &#8220;facilitating or grease payments,&#8221; small amounts of money paid to low-level government workers in an effort to speed routine tasks like processing paperwork or turning on electricity, but not to influence the granting of a contract.</p>

Although some believe the FCPA disadvantages U.S. firms competing in foreign markets, others say it is the backbone of an ethical free enterprise system. The argument against strong enforcement of the FCPA has some merit according to managers in the field, and there is a general sense that illegal or unethical conduct is sometimes necessary for success. An attorney for energy-related company Cinergy summed up the feelings of many executives: &#8220;Shame on the Justice Department&#8217;s myopic view and inability to understand the realities of the world.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_rf-007" id="e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca-endNote31"><sup class="os-end-note-number">31</sup></a> Some nations consider business bribery to be culturally acceptable and turn a blind eye to such activities.</c:para>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm346128688">The argument in favor of FCPA enforcement has its supporters as well, who assert that the law not only covers the activities of U.S. companies but also levels the playing field because of its broad jurisdiction over foreign enterprises and their officials. The fact is that since the United States passed the FCPA, other nations have followed suit. The 1997 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention has been instrumental in getting its signatories (the United Kingdom and most European Union nations) to enact stricter antibribery laws. The United Kingdom adopted the Bribery Act in 2010, Canada adopted the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act of 1999, and European Union nations have done the same. There is also the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, which has forty-three signatories, including all thirty-five OECD countries and eight other countries.</p>

<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm345357056">Of course, bribery is just one of many ethical dilemmas an employee might face in the workplace. Not all such dilemmas are governed by the clear-cut rules generally laid out for illegal acts such as bribery. Employees may find themselves being asked to do something that is legal but not considered ethical. For example, an employee might receive confidential proprietary knowledge about another firm that would give his or her firm an unfair competitive advantage. Should the employee act on this information?</p>
<div class="what-would" data-type="note" id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm343648128"><h3 class="os-title" data-type="title"><span class="os-title-label">What Would You Do?</span></h3><div class="os-note-body"><h4 data-type="title" id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_26020" class="os-subtitle"><span class="os-subtitle-label">Should You Act on Information If You Have Doubts?</span></h4><p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm343750336">Assume you are a partner in a successful computer consulting firm bidding for a contract with a large insurance company. Your chief rival is a firm that has usually offered services and prices similar to yours. However, from a new employee who used to work for that firm, you learn that it is unveiling a new competitive price structure and accelerated delivery dates, which will undercut the terms you had been prepared to offer the insurance company. Assume you have verified that the new employee is not in violation of any non-compete or nondisclosure agreement and therefore the information was not given to you illegally.</p>

<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm356837792">Would you change prices and delivery dates to beat your rival? Or would you inform both your rival and potential customer of what you have learned? Why?</p>
</div></div>
<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm341920896">Most companies say they want all employees to obey the law and make ethical decisions. But employees typically should not be expected to make ethical decisions based just on gut instinct; they need guidance, training, and leadership to help them navigate the maze of grey areas that present themselves daily in business. This guidance can be provided by the company through standard setting and the development of ethical codes of conduct and policies. Senior managers modeling ethical behavior and so leading by direct example also provide significant direction.</p>

<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm344802976">For decades, most U.S. companies enforced <span data-type="term" id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_term214" group-by="p">pay secrecy</span>, a policy that prohibits employees from disclosing or discussing salaries among themselves. The reason was obvious: Companies did not want to be scrutinized for their salary decisions. They knew that if workers were aware of what each was paid, they would question the inequities that pay secrecy kept hidden from them.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_89348">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm318080288">Recently, the situation has begun to change. Ten states have enacted new laws banning employers from imposing pay secrecy rules: California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Vermont.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_rf-001" id="2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8-endNote32"><sup class="os-end-note-number">32</sup></a> The real game changer came in 2012, when multiple decisions by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and various federal courts made it clear that most pay secrecy policies are unenforceable and violate federal labor law (National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 157-158).<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_rf-002" id="2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8-endNote33"><sup class="os-end-note-number">33</sup></a> Generally speaking, labor law lends employees the right to engage in collective activities, including that of discussing with each other the specifics of their individual employment arrangements, which includes how much they are paid. Moreover, the applicable sections of the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) apply to union and non-union employees, so there is no exception made for companies whose employees are non-unionized, meaning the law protects all workers. In 2014, President Barack Obama issued an executive order banning companies that engaged in federal contracting from prohibiting such salary discussions.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_rf-003" id="2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8-endNote34"><sup class="os-end-note-number">34</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm343611872">Opening up the discussion of pay acknowledges the growing desire of employees to be well informed and to have the freedom to question or criticize their company. If employees cannot talk about something at work because they think it will make their boss angry, where do they go instead? Social media can be a likely answer. Protections generally extend to salary discussions on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram; Section 7 of the NRLA protects two or more employees who act together or discuss improving their terms and conditions of employment in person or online, just as it does in other settings.</p>

<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm342740464">Does the First Amendment protect employees at work who criticize their boss or their company? Generally, no. That answer may surprise those who believe that the First Amendment protects all speech. It does not. The Bill of Rights was created to protect citizens from an overreaching government, not from their employer. The First Amendment reads as follows:</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm328347808"><q id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm312824368">&#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&#8221;</q></p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm327488272">The key words are &#8220;Congress shall make no law,&#8221; meaning the content of speech is something the government and politicians cannot control with laws or policies. However, this right of free speech is generally not applicable to the private sector workplace and does not cover criticism of your employer.</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm341920400">Does that mean an employee can be fired for criticizing the company or boss? Yes, under most circumstances. Therefore, if someone posts a message on social media that says, &#8220;My boss is a jerk&#8221; or &#8220;My company is a terrible place to work,&#8221; the likelihood is that the person can be fired without any recourse, assuming he or she is an employee at will (see the discussion of at-will employment earlier in this chapter). Unless the act of firing constitutes a violation under federal law, such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the speech is not protected speech, and thus the speaker (the employee) is not protected.</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm342827680">At some point, all of us may get angry with our companies or supervisors, but we still have a duty to keep our disputes in-house and not make public any situations we are attempting to resolve internally. Employers typically are prohibited from discussing human resource matters relating to any specific employees. Employees, too, should keep complaints confidential unless and until crimes are charged or civil suits are filed.</p>

In other words, this was not an attempt to stimulate discussion but rather an anonymous one-way (and one-time) post. &#8220;Here, Duane&#8217;s posting on Glassdoor.com was not a social media posting like Facebook or Twitter. Instead, Glassdoor.com is a website used by respondent and prospective employees as a recruiting tool to recruit prospective employees.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_rf-006" id="2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8-endNote37"><sup class="os-end-note-number">37</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm350399680">The rules related to social media are evolving, but applicable laws do not generally distinguish between sites or locations in which someone might criticize an employer, so criticism of the boss remains largely unprotected speech. As discussed earlier, employees can go online and post information about wages, hours, and working conditions, and that speech is protected by federal statute. So, although some general complaints against employers are not protected under the First Amendment, they may be protected under the NLRA (because arguably they may be related to terms and conditions of employment). However, most courts agree that statements personally critical of the boss or the company on a basis other than wages and working conditions are not protected. Obviously, there is no protection when employees post false or misleading information on social media in an attempt to harm the company&#8217;s reputation or that of management.</p>

<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm346983552">The act of <span data-type="term" id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_term215" group-by="w">whistleblowing</span>&#8212;going to an official government agency and disclosing an employer&#8217;s violation of the law&#8212;is different from everyday criticism. In fact, whistleblowing is largely viewed as a public service because it helps society reduce bad workplace behavior. Being a whistleblower is not easy, however, and someone inclined to act as one should expect many hurdles. If a whistleblower&#8217;s identity becomes known, his or her revelations may amount to career suicide. Even if they keep their job, whistleblowers often are not promoted, and they may face resentment not only from management but also from rank-and-file workers who fear the loss of their own jobs. Whistleblowers may also be blacklisted, making it difficult for them to get a job at a different firm, and all as a result of doing what is ethical.</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm351853760">Blowing the whistle on your employer is thus a big decision with significant ramifications. However, most employees do not want to cover up unethical or illegal conduct, nor should they. When should employees decide to blow the whistle on their boss or company? Ethicists say it should be done with an appropriate motive&#8212;to get the company to comply with the law or to protect potential victims&#8212;and not to get revenge on a boss at whom you are angry. Of course, even if an employee has a personal revenge motive, if the company actively is breaking the law, it is still important that the wrongdoing be reported. In any case, knowing when and how to blow the whistle is a challenge for an employee wanting to do the right thing.</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm345777232">The employee should usually try internal reporting channels first, to disclose the problem to management before going public. Sometimes workers mistakenly identify something as wrongdoing that was not wrongdoing after all. Internal reporting gives management a chance to start an investigation and attempt to rectify the situation. The employee who goes to the government should also have some kind of hard evidence that wrongful actions have occurred; the violation should be serious, and blowing the whistle should have some likelihood of stopping the wrongful act.</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm348402464">Under many federal laws, an employer cannot retaliate by firing, demoting, or taking any other adverse action against workers who report injuries, concerns, or other protected activity. One of the first laws with a specific whistleblower protection provision was the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Since passage of that law, Congress has expanded whistleblower authority to protect workers who report violations of more than twenty different federal laws across various topics. (There is no all-purpose whistleblower protection; it must be granted by individual statutes.)</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm347089552">A sample of the specific laws under which whistleblowing employees are protected can be found in the environmental area, where it is in the public interest for employees to report violations of the law to the authorities, which, in turn, helps the average citizen concerned about clean air and water. The Clean Air Act protects any employee reporting air emission violations from area, stationary, and mobile sources from any retaliation for such reporting. The Water Pollution Control Act similarly protects from retaliation any employee who reports alleged violations relating to discharge of pollutants into water.</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm348730912">Without the help of employees who are &#8220;on the ground&#8221; and see the violations occur, it could be difficult for government regulators to always find the source of pollution. Even when whistleblowers are not acting completely altruistically, their revelations may still be true and worthy of being brought to the public&#8217;s attention. Thus, in such situations, the responsible employee becomes a steward of the public interest, and we all should want whistleblowers to come forward. Yet not all whistleblowers are white knights, and not all their firms are evil dragons worthy of being slain.</p>

<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm357860192">Blowing the whistle may bring the employee more than just intrinsic ethical rewards; it may also result in cash. The most lucrative law under which employees can blow the whistle is the False Claims Act (FCA), 31 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3729&#8211;3733. This legislation was enacted in 1863, during the American Civil War, because Congress was worried that suppliers of goods to the Union Army might cheat the government. The FCA has been amended many times since then, and today it serves as a leading example of a statutory law that remains important after more than 150 years. The FCA provides that any person who knowingly submits false claims to the government must pay a civil penalty for each false claim, plus triple the amount of the government&#8217;s damages. The amount of this basic civil penalty is regularly adjusted by the cost of living, and the current penalty range is from $5500 to $11,000.</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm342874000">More importantly for our discussion, the <span data-type="term" id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_term216" group-by="q">qui tam provision</span> of the law allows private persons (called relators) to file lawsuits for violations of the FCA on behalf of the government and to receive part of any penalty imposed. The person bringing the action is a type of a whistleblower, but one who initiates legal action on his or her own rather than simply reporting it to a government agency. If the government believes it is a worthwhile case and intervenes in the lawsuit, then the relator (whistleblower) is entitled to receive between 15 and 25 percent of the amount the government recovers. If the government thinks winning is a long shot and declines to intervene in the lawsuit, the relator&#8217;s share increases to 25 to 30 percent.</p>

Birkenfeld also spent time in prison for participating in the tax fraud he reported. In 2009, ten former Pfizer employees were awarded $102 million for exposing an illegal promotion of prescription medications. John Kopchinski, the original whistleblower and one of the ten, received $50 million. In another case involving the health care company HCA, two employees who blew the whistle on Medicare fraud ended up receiving a combined total of $100 million.</c:para>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm328015680">It is not just the size of the reward that should get your attention but also the amount of money these employees saved taxpayers and/or shareholders. They turned in companies that were cheating the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (affecting taxpayers), the IRS (affecting government revenues), and private health insurance (affecting premiums). The public saved far more than the reward paid to the whistleblowers.</p>

Many complex cases of business fraud can go on for several years before a verdict is rendered and appealed (or a settlement is reached). An employee whose identity has been disclosed and who has been unofficially blacklisted may not see any reward money for several years.</c:para>

She was ignored more than once and eventually went to the press with her story. Because she did not go directly to the SEC, Watkins received no whistleblower protection.

<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm348094960">Sometimes employees, including managers, face an ethical dilemma that they seek to address from within rather than becoming a whistleblower. The risk is that they may be ignored or that their speaking up will be held against them. However, companies should want and expect employees to step forward and report wrongdoing to their superiors, and they should support that decision, not punish it. Sallie Krawcheck, a financial industry executive, was not a whistleblower in either the classical or the legal sense. She went to her boss with her discovery of wrongdoing at work, which means she had no legal protection under whistleblower statutes. Read her story in the following box.</p>
<div class="real-world" data-type="note" id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm356838864"><h3 class="os-title" data-type="title"><span class="os-title-label">Cases from the Real World</span></h3><div class="os-note-body"><h4 data-type="title" id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_9106" class="os-subtitle"><span class="os-subtitle-label">Sallie Krawcheck and Merrill Lynch</span></h4><p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm352634784">Shortly after Sallie Krawcheck took over as chief of Merrill Lynch&#8217;s wealth management division at Bank of America, she discovered that a mutual fund called the Stable Value Fund, a financial product Merrill had sold to customers as an investment for their 401k plans, was not as stable as its name implied. The team at Merrill had made a mistake by managing the fund in a way that assumed a higher risk than was acceptable to its investors, and the fund ended up losing much of its value. Unfortunately, because it was supposed to be a low-risk fund, the people who had invested in it, and who would suffer most from Merrill&#8217;s mistakes, were earners of relatively modest incomes, including Walmart employees, who made up the largest group.</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm350473904">According to Krawcheck, she had two options. Option one was to say tough luck to the Stable Value Fund&#8217;s investors, including the Walmart employees, explaining that all investments carry some degree of risk. Option two was to bail out the investors by pouring money into the fund to increase its value. Krawcheck had already been burned once by trying to be ethical. She had been head of CitiGroup&#8217;s wealth management division (Smith Barney); in that capacity, she had made a decision to reimburse clients for some of their losses she felt were due to company mistakes. Rather than supporting her decision, however, CitiGroup terminated her, in large part for making the ethical decision rather than the profitable one. Now she was in the same predicament with a new company. Should Krawcheck risk her job again by choosing the ethical act, or should she make a purely financial decision and tell the 401k investors they would have to take the loss?</p>
<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm353889040">Krawcheck began talking to people inside and outside the company to see what they thought. Most told her to just keep her head down and do nothing. One &#8220;industry titan&#8221; told her there was nothing to be done, that everyone knows stable-value funds are not really stable. Unconvinced, Krawcheck took the problem to Bank of America&#8217;s CEO. He agreed to back her up and put company money into the depleted stable-value funds to prop them up.</p>

(You discovered this accidentally, and it would be difficult for anyone else to find it out.) You take this information to one of the principals, whom you know well and respect. He tells you apologetically that the overcharges became necessary when the firm seriously underestimated total project costs in its bid on the contract.

<p id="auto_b86572d8-b4aa-481f-bba6-b6ad2176e8d0_fs-idm253845888">Although employees&#8217; and employers&#8217; concepts of loyalty have changed, it is reasonable to expect workers to have a basic sense of responsibility to their company and willingness to protect a variety of important assets such as intellectual property and trade secrets. Current employees should not compete with their employer in a way that would violate conflict-of-interest rules, and former employees should not solicit previous customers or employees upon leaving employment.</p>

<p id="auto_a1b5f458-bf93-45b6-9d51-0db6e1f54c8c_fs-idm259165232">Employees have a duty to be loyal to the brand and treat customers well. Internal marketing is one process by which a company instills employee commitment to the brand and builds loyalty in its workforce. This loyalty should be a two-way street, however. If the company wants its employees to treat customers with respect, it must treat them with respect as well.</p>

<p id="auto_1677027e-ead9-4e0d-8c50-a057ff1d468e_fs-idm252006480">Ethical employees accept their role in creating a workplace that is respectful, safe, and welcoming by getting along with coworkers and doing what is best for the company. They also comply with corporate codes of conduct, which cover a wide range of behaviors, from financial dealings and bribery to sexual harassment. In addition, they are alert to any situation in the workplace that could escalate into violence. In short, the employee has a duty to be a responsible person in the job.</p>

<p id="auto_e53a69a0-1443-453e-8e8c-5857e5acd3ca_fs-idm353561344">Legal and cultural differences may allow bribes in other countries, but bribery and insider trading (which allows someone with private information about securities to profit from that knowledge at the public&#8217;s expense) are illegal in the United States, as well as unethical. A clear gift policy should be in place to help employees understand when it is acceptable to accept a gift from another employee or an outsider (such as a vendor), and to distinguish gifts from bribes.</p>

<p id="auto_2ca18db1-1f72-4dd2-94d8-c29f50c286d8_fs-idm344244000">Employees should understand that there are limits to what can be posted about their employer online, just as there are limits to what they can say in the workplace, and that the First Amendment generally does not protect such speech. Whistleblowers are protected, and sometimes rewarded, for their willingness to come forward, but they can still face a hostile environment in some situations. Employees should not use whistleblowing as an attempt to get back at a boss or employer they do not like; rather, they should use it as a means to stop serious wrongdoing.</p>

<p id="auto_43f866da-44c3-46be-bfaa-418146a98734_fs-idm250407584">Effective business managers in the twenty-first century need to be aware of a broad array of ethical choices they can make that affect their employees, their customers, and society as a whole. What these decisions have in common is the need for managers to recognize and respect the rights of all.</p>



<p id="auto_43f866da-44c3-46be-bfaa-418146a98734_fs-idm205642192">Actively supporting human diversity at work, for instance, benefits the business organization as well as society on a broader level (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_43f866da-44c3-46be-bfaa-418146a98734_OSX_Ethics_08_00_Opener">Figure 8.1</a>). Thus, ethical managers recognize and accommodate the special needs of some employees, show respect for workers&#8217; different faiths, appreciate and accept their differing sexual orientations and identification, and ensure pay equity for all. Ethical managers are also tuned in to public sentiment, such as calls by stakeholders to respect the rights of animals, and they monitor trends in these social attitudes, especially on social media.</p>



<p id="auto_43f866da-44c3-46be-bfaa-418146a98734_fs-idm253472928">How would you, as a manager, ensure a workplace that values inclusion and diversity? How would you respond to employees who resisted such a workplace? How would you approach broader social concerns such as income inequality or animal rights? This chapter introduces the potential impacts on business of some of the most pressing social themes of our time, and it discusses ways managers can respect the rights of all <em data-effect="italics">and</em> improve business results by choosing an ethical path.</p>

<p id="auto_e0d50c28-f084-4d80-a1a1-89d20fd47a72_fs-idm250025648">Diversity is not simply a box to be checked; rather, it is an approach to business that unites ethical management and high performance. Business leaders in the global economy recognize the benefits of a diverse workforce and see it as an organizational strength, not as a mere slogan or a form of regulatory compliance with the law. They recognize that diversity can enhance performance and drive innovation; conversely, adhering to the traditional business practices of the past can cost them talented employees and loyal customers.</p>

<p id="auto_e0d50c28-f084-4d80-a1a1-89d20fd47a72_fs-idm207963904">The twenty-first century workplace features much greater diversity than was common even a couple of generations ago. Individuals who might once have faced employment challenges because of religious beliefs, ability differences, or sexual orientation now regularly join their peers in interview pools and on the job. Each may bring a new outlook and different information to the table; employees can no longer take for granted that their coworkers think the same way they do. This pushes them to question their own assumptions, expand their understanding, and appreciate alternate viewpoints. The result is more creative ideas, approaches, and solutions. Thus, diversity may also enhance corporate decision-making.</p>

In fact, the results reveal a negative correlation between performance and lack of diversity, with companies in the bottom 25 percent for gender and ethnicity or race proving to be statistically less likely to achieve above-average financial returns than the average companies. Non-diverse companies were not leaders in performance indicators. Positive correlations do not equal causation, of course, and greater gender and ethnic diversity do not automatically translate into profit. Rather, as this chapter shows, they enhance creativity and decision-making, employee satisfaction, an ethical work environment, and customer goodwill, all of which, in turn, improve operations and boost performance.</p>

It is a basic assumption of an egalitarian society that all have the same chance without being hindered by immutable characteristics. However, there are also directly relevant business reasons to do it. More diverse companies perform better, as we saw earlier in this chapter, but why? The reasons are intriguing and complex. Among them are that diversity improves a company&#8217;s chances of attracting top talent and that considering all points of view may lead to better decision-making. Diversity also improves customer experience and employee satisfaction.</p>
<p id="auto_e0d50c28-f084-4d80-a1a1-89d20fd47a72_fs-idm259262240">To achieve improved results, companies need to expand their definition of diversity beyond race and gender. For example, differences in age, experience, and country of residence may result in a more refined global mind-set and cultural fluency, which can help companies succeed in international business. A salesperson may know the language of customers or potential customers from a specific region or country, for example, or a customer service representative may understand the norms of another culture. Diverse product-development teams can grasp what a group of customers may want that is not currently being offered.</p>
<p id="auto_e0d50c28-f084-4d80-a1a1-89d20fd47a72_fs-idm245043312">Resorting to the same approaches repeatedly is not likely to result in breakthrough solutions. Diversity, however, provides usefully divergent perspectives on the business challenges companies face. New ideas help solve old problems&#8212;another way diversity makes a positive contribution to the bottom line.</p>

Some employees simply are slow to come around to a greater appreciation of the value of diversity because they may never have considered this perspective before. Others may be prejudiced and consequently attempt to undermine the success of diversity initiatives in general. In 2017, for example, a senior software engineer&#8217;s memo criticizing Google&#8217;s diversity initiatives was leaked, creating significant protests on social media and adverse publicity in national news outlets.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_e0d50c28-f084-4d80-a1a1-89d20fd47a72_rf-013" id="e0d50c28-f084-4d80-a1a1-89d20fd47a72-endNote13"><sup class="os-end-note-number">13</sup></a> The memo asserted &#8220;biological causes&#8221; and &#8220;men&#8217;s higher drive for status&#8221; to account for women&#8217;s unequal representation in Google&#8217;s technology departments and leadership.</c:para>

<p id="auto_e0d50c28-f084-4d80-a1a1-89d20fd47a72_fs-idm237538640">Yet other employees are resistant to change in whatever form it takes. As inclusion initiatives and considerations of diversity become more prominent in employment practices, wise leaders should be prepared to fully explain the advantages to the company of greater diversity in the workforce as well as making the appropriate accommodations to support it. Accommodations can take various forms. For example, if you hire more women, should you change the way you run meetings so everyone has a chance to be heard? Have you recognized that women returning to work after childrearing may bring improved skills such as time management or the ability to work well under pressure? If you are hiring more people of different faiths, should you set aside a prayer room? Should you give out tickets to football games as incentives? Or build team spirit with trips to a local bar? Your managers may need to accept that these initiatives may not suit everyone. Adherents of some faiths may abstain from alcohol, and some people prefer cultural events to sports. Many might welcome a menu of perquisites (&#8220;perks&#8221;) from which to choose, and these will not necessarily be the ones that were valued in the past. Mentoring new and diverse peers can help erase bias and overcome preconceptions about others. However, all levels of a company must be engaged in achieving diversity, and all must work together to overcome resistance.</p>

It is also ethical to have compassion for those who want to work and be contributing members of society. This principle holds for customers as well as employees. Recognizing the need for protection in this area, the federal government has enacted several laws to provide it. The Disability Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice lists ten different federal laws protecting people with disabilities, including not only the ADA but also laws such as the Rehabilitation Act, the Air Carrier Access Act, and the Architectural Barriers Act.</p>

Managers need to be able to recognize the variety of ways in which a request for an accommodation is communicated. For example, an employee might not specifically say, &#8220;I need a reasonable accommodation for my disability&#8221; but rather, &#8220;I&#8217;m having a hard time getting to work on time because of the medical treatments I&#8217;m undergoing.&#8221; This example demonstrates a challenge employers may face under the ADA in properly identifying requests for accommodation.</p>

The suit asserted that Verizon denied reasonable accommodations to several hundred employees, disciplining or firing them for missing too many days of work and refusing to make exceptions for those whose absences were caused by their disabilities. According to the EEOC, Verizon violated the ADA because its no-fault attendance policy was an inflexible and &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; one-size-fits-all rule.</p>
<p id="auto_7575d025-fb89-4216-b191-7ff09ef9ca36_fs-idm197556272">The EEOC required Verizon to pay $20 million to settle the suit, the largest single disability discrimination settlement in the agency&#8217;s history. The settlement also forced Verizon to change its attendance policy to include reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities. A third requirement was that Verizon provide regular training on ADA requirements to all mangers responsible for administering attendance policies.</p>

<p id="auto_7575d025-fb89-4216-b191-7ff09ef9ca36_fs-idm205389072">Title VII of the CRA, which governs nondiscrimination, applies the same rules to the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_7575d025-fb89-4216-b191-7ff09ef9ca36_term226" group-by="r">religious beliefs</span> (or nonbeliefs) of employees and job applicants as it does to race, gender, and other categories. The essence of the law mandates four tenets that all employers should follow: nondiscrimination, nonharassment, nonretaliation, and reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p id="auto_7575d025-fb89-4216-b191-7ff09ef9ca36_fs-idm192437664">Regulations require that an employee notify the employer of a bona fide religious belief for which he or she wants protection, but the employee need not expressly request a specific accommodation. The employer must consider all possible accommodations that do not require violating the individual&#8217;s beliefs and/or practices, such as allowing time off (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7575d025-fb89-4216-b191-7ff09ef9ca36_OSX_Ethics_08_02_Calendar">Figure 8.6</a>). However, the accommodation need not pose undue hardship on the firm, in terms of either scheduling or financial sacrifice. The employer must present proof of hardship if it decides it cannot offer an accommodation.</p>

The oil industry has a long tradition of outdoor barbecues, and this one is a big morale-building event. However, June 19 is &#8220;Juneteenth,&#8221; the day on which news of the Emancipation Proclamation reached slaves in Texas in 1865. Several African American employees always attend the barbecue event and are looking forward to it, but they also want to celebrate Emancipation Day, rich in history and culture and accompanied by its own official event. The picnic date cannot be easily rescheduled because of all the catering arrangements that had to be made.</p>

The middle class, often called the engine of growth and prosperity, is shrinking, and new ethical, cultural, and economic problems are following from that change. Some identify income inequality as an ethical problem, some as an economic problem. Perhaps it is both. This section will address income inequality and the way it affects U.S. businesses and consumers.</p>

<p id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_fs-idm248760736">The U.S. economy was built largely on the premise of an expanding and prosperous <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_term231" group-by="m">middle class</span> to which everyone had a chance of belonging. This ideal set the United States apart from other countries, in its own eyes and those of the world. In the years after World War II, the GI Bill and returning prosperity provided veterans with money for education, home mortgages, and even small businesses, all of which helped the economy grow. For the first time, many people could afford homes of their own, and residential home construction reached record rates. Families bought cars and opened credit card accounts. The culture of the middle class with picket fences, backyard barbecues, and black-and-white televisions had arrived. Television shows such as <em data-effect="italics">Leave it to Beaver</em> and <em data-effect="italics">Father Knows Best</em> reflected the &#8220;good life&#8221; desired by many in this newly emerging group. By the mid-1960s, middle-class wage earners were fast becoming the engine of the world&#8217;s largest economy.</p>

For example, split fairly evenly between Democratic and Republican parties, the middle class helped elect Republican George W. Bush in 2004 and Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. And, of course, a suburban house with a white picket fence represents a consumption economy, which is not everyone&#8217;s idea of utopia, nor should it be. More importantly, not everyone had equal access to this ideal. But one thing almost everyone agrees on is that a <em data-effect="italics">shrinking</em> middle class is not good for the economy. Data from the International Monetary Fund indicate the U.S. middle class is going in the wrong direction.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-002" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote31"><sup class="os-end-note-number">31</sup></a> Only one-quarter of 1 percent of all U.S. households have moved up from the middle- to the upper-income bracket since 2000, while twelve times that many have slid to the lower-income bracket.

According to <em data-effect="italics">Business Insider</em>, the U.S. middle class is &#8220;hollowing out, and it&#8217;s hurting U.S. economic growth.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-003" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote32"><sup class="os-end-note-number">32</sup></a></c:para>

Because consumers of comfortable means are a huge driver of the U.S. economy, with their household consumption of goods and services like food, energy, and education making up more than two-thirds of the nation&#8217;s gross domestic product (GDP), the downward trend is an economic challenge for corporate America and the government. Business must be part of the solution. But exactly what can U.S. companies do to help address income inequality?</p>

<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_47377">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm244721072">Robert Reich was U.S. Secretary of Labor from 1993 to 1997 and served in the administrations of three presidents (Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton). He is one of the nation&#8217;s leading experts on the labor market and the economy and is currently the chancellor&#8217;s professor of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a senior fellow at the Blum Center for Developing Economies. Reich recently told this story: &#8220;I was visited in my office by the chairman of one of the country&#8217;s biggest high-tech firms. He wanted to talk about the causes and consequences of widening inequality and the shrinking middle class, and what to do about it.&#8221; Reich asked the chairman why he was concerned. &#8220;Because the American middle class is the core of our customer base. If they can&#8217;t afford our products in the years ahead, we&#8217;re in deep trouble.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-004" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote33"><sup class="os-end-note-number">33</sup></a></c:para>

Business leaders know the U.S. economy cannot grow when wages are declining, nor can their businesses succeed over the long term without a growing or at least a stable middle class. Other business leaders, such as Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, have also said that income inequality is a negative development. Reich quoted Blankfein: &#8220;It is destabilizing the nation and is responsible for the divisions in the country . . . too much of the GDP over the last generation has gone to too few of the people.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-005" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote34"><sup class="os-end-note-number">34</sup></a></c:para>

Many business leaders and economists agree that a higher minimum wage would help address at least part of the problem of income inequality; industrialized economies function best when income inequality is minimal, according to Gross and others who advocate for policies that bring the power of workers and corporations back into balance.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-006" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote35"><sup class="os-end-note-number">35</sup></a> A hike in the minimum wage affects middle-class workers in two ways. First, it is a direct help to those who are part of a two-earner family at the lower end of the middle class, giving them more income to spend on necessities. Second, many higher-paid workers earn a wage that is tied to the minimum wage. Their salaries would increase as well.</c:para>

Frank Knapp, CEO of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce representing five thousand business owners, said a higher minimum wage &#8220;will put more money in the hands of 300,000 South Carolinians who make less than ten dollars per hour and they will spend it here in our local economies. This minimum wage increase will also benefit another 150,000 employees who will have their wages adjusted. The resulting net $500 million increase in state GDP will be good for small businesses and good for the economy of South Carolina.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-009" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote38"><sup class="os-end-note-number">38</sup></a></c:para>

For decades, some companies have hired many full-time workers as independent contractors because it saves them money on a variety of employee benefits they do not have to offer as a result. However, that practice shifts the burden to the workers, who now have to pay the full cost of their health insurance, workers&#8217; compensation, unemployment benefits, time off, and payroll taxes. A recent Department of Labor study indicates that employer costs for employee compensation averaged $35.64 per hour worked in September 2017; wages and salaries averaged $24.33 per hour worked and accounted for 68 percent of these costs, whereas benefit costs averaged $11.31 and accounted for the remaining 32 percent.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-010" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote39"><sup class="os-end-note-number">39</sup></a> That means if employees on the payroll were paid as independent contractors, their pay would effectively be about one-third less, assuming they purchased benefits on their own. The 30 percent difference companies save by hiring independent contractors is often the margin between being in the middle class and falling below it.</c:para>

This is a story many middle-class families in the United States think could happen only to someone else, never to them. However, an HBO documentary entitled <em data-effect="italics">American Winter</em> suggests the opposite is true; many seemingly solid middle-class families can slip all too easily into the lower class, into poverty, in houses that are dark with empty refrigerators.</p>
<p id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_fs-idm247327856">The film, set in Portland, Oregon, tells the story of an economic tragedy. Families that were once financially stable are now barely keeping their heads above water. A needed job was outsourced or given to an independent contractor, or a raise failed to come even as necessities kept getting more expensive. The families had to try to pay for healthcare or make a mortgage payment when their bank account was overdrawn. Once-proud middle-class workers talk about the shame of having to ask friends for help or turn to public assistance as a last resort. The fall of the U.S. middle class is more than a line on an economic chart; it is a cold reality for many families who never saw it coming.</p>

Indeed, some economists have questioned whether a positive correlation exists between greater wages and a lowering of the poverty rate. Representative of such thought is the work of David Neumark, an economist at the University of California, Irvine, and William L. Wascher, a long-time economic researcher on the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. They argue that, however well-meaning such efforts might be, simply raising the minimum wage can be counterproductive to driving down poverty. Rather, they maintain, the right calculus for achieving this goal is much more complex. As they put it, &#8220;we are hard-pressed to imagine a compelling argument for a higher minimum wage when it neither helps low-income families nor reduces poverty.&#8221; Instead, the federal and state governments should consider a series of steps, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, that would be more effective in mitigating poverty.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-011" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote40"><sup class="os-end-note-number">40</sup></a></c:para>

<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_73612">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm255542704">The issue of income inequality is of particular significance as it relates to women. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), gender inequality is strongly associated with income inequality.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-012" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote41"><sup class="os-end-note-number">41</sup></a> The WEF studied the association between the two phenomena in 140 countries over the past twenty years and discovered they are linked virtually everywhere, not only in developing nations. The issue of pay discrimination is addressed elsewhere in this textbook; however, the issue merits mention here as a part of the bigger picture of equality in the workplace. Adding to the disparity in income between men and women is the reality that many women are single mothers with dependent children and sometimes grandchildren. Hence, any reduction in their earning power has direct implications for their dependents, too, constituting injustice to multiple generations.</c:para>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_55232">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm258068736">According to multiple studies, including those by the American Association of University Women and the Pew Research Center, on average, women are paid approximately 80 percent of what men are paid.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-013" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote42"><sup class="os-end-note-number">42</sup></a> Laws that attempt to address this issue have not eradicated the problem. A recent trend is to take legislative action at the state rather than the federal level. A New Jersey law, for example, was named the Diane B. Allen Equal Pay Act to honor a retired state senator who experienced pay discrimination.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_rf-014" id="8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe-endNote43"><sup class="os-end-note-number">43</sup></a> It will be the strongest such law in the country, allowing victims of discrimination to seek redress for up to six years of underpayment, and monetary damages for a prevailing plaintiff will be tripled.</c:para>
<p id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_fs-idm262685776">The most significant part of the law, however, is a seemingly small change in wording that will have a big impact. Rather than requiring &#8220;equal pay for equal work,&#8221; as does the federal law and most state laws aimed at the <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_term233" group-by="g">gender wage gap</span>, the Diane B. Allen Equal Pay Act will require &#8220;equal pay for substantially similar work.&#8221; This means that if a New Jersey woman has a different title than her male colleague but performs the same kinds of tasks and has the same level of responsibility, she must be paid the same. The new law recognizes that slight differences in job titles are sometimes used to justify pay differences but in reality are often arbitrary.</p>
<p id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_fs-idm224841168">Minnesota recently passed a similar law, but it applies only to state government employees, not private-sector workers. It mandates that women be paid the same for comparable jobs and analyzes the work performed on the basis of how much knowledge, problem solving, and responsibility is required, and on working conditions rather than merely on job titles.</p>
<p id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_fs-idm249783600">Ethical business managers will see this trend as an effort to address an ethical issue that has existed for well over a century and will follow the lead of states such as New Jersey and Minnesota. A company can help solve this problem by changing the way it uses job titles and creating a compensation system built on the ideas behind these two laws, which focus on job characteristics and not titles.</p>

<p id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_fs-idm197821392">Ethical questions about our treatment of animals arise in several different industries, such as agriculture, medicine, and cosmetics. This section addresses these questions because they form part of the larger picture of the way society treats all living things&#8212;including nonhuman animals as well as the environment. All states in the United States have some form of laws to protect animals; some violations carry criminal penalties and some carry civil penalties. Consumer groups and the media have also applied pressure to the business community to consider animal ethics seriously, and businesses have discovered money to be made in the booming business of pets. Of course, as always, we should acknowledge that culture and geography influence our understanding of ethical issues at a personal and a business level.</p>

<p id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_fs-idm200156016">Rhode Island, along with Boulder, Colorado, and Berkeley, California, led the way in enacting legislation recognizing individuals as guardians, not owners, of their animals, thus giving animals legal status beyond being just items of property. Many U.S. colleges now teach courses on animal rights law, there is strong support for granting fundamental legal rights to animals, and some attorneys, scientists, and ethicists dedicate their careers to animal rights.</p>
<p id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_fs-idm190554032">The animal movement started in the late nineteenth century when the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was formed, along with the American Humane Association. The American Welfare Institute and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) were established in the 1950s. The first federal animal protection law, the Humane Slaughter Act, was passed in the 1950s to avoid unnecessary suffering to farm animals (ten billion of which are killed every year). The most important U.S. law forbidding cruelty to animals in laboratory settings was enacted in 1966; the Animal Welfare Act requires basic humane conditions to be maintained for animals in testing facilities. Finally, in the 1970s and 1980s, the modern animal rights social movement emerged. It has led to an increased awareness of animal ethics by consumers and businesses.</p>
<p id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_fs-idm201139280">However, despite significant progress, research using animals for product testing continues to be controversial in the United States, particularly because improved technology has offered humane and effective alternatives. The use of animals in biomedical research has drawn slightly less negative reaction than in consumer product testing, because of the more critical nature of the research. Though animal welfare laws have ameliorated some of the pain of animals used in biomedical research, ethical concerns remain, and veterinarians and physicians are demanding change, as are animal rights groups and policy and ethics experts. Increased integration of ethics in business conduct is operating alongside the desire to recognize <span data-type="term" id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_term234" group-by="a">animal rights</span>, the entitlement of nonhuman animals to ethical treatment.</p>

This is where groups such as the ASPCA and HSUS have been particularly active. Agribusiness is a huge industry that provides us with the food we eat, including plant-based and animal-based foodstuffs. The industry has changed significantly over the past century, evolving from one consisting primarily of family and/or small businesses to a much larger one dominated mostly by large corporations. Aspects of this business with relevant and interrelated ethical questions range from ecology, animal rights, and economics to food safety and long-term sustainability (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_OSX_Ethics_08_05_AgriEthics">Figure 8.11</a>). To achieve a high level of sustainability in the world&#8217;s food supply chain, all stakeholders&#8212;the political sector, the business sector, the finance sector, the academic sector, and the consumer&#8212;must work in concert to achieve an optimal result, and a cost-benefit analysis of ethics in the food industry should include a recognition of all their concerns.</p>

<p id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_fs-idm190549984">Experts predict that for us to meet the food needs of the world&#8217;s population, we will need to double food production over the next fifty years. Given this, a high priority in the agribusiness industry ought to be to meet this demand for food at a reasonable price with products that are not a threat to human health and safety, animal health, or the limited resources in Earth&#8217;s environment. However, to do so requires attention to factors such as soil and surface water conservation and protection of natural land and water areas. Furthermore, the treatment of animals by everyone in the livestock chain (e.g., livestock farmers, dealers, fish farmers, animal transporters, slaughterhouses) must be appropriate for a society with high legal and ethical standards.</p>
<p id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_fs-idm198269936">The food chain can be truly sustainable only when it safeguards the social welfare and living environment of the people working in it. This means eliminating corruption, human rights violations (including forced labor and child labor), and poor working conditions. We must also encourage and empower consumers to make informed choices, which includes enforcing labeling regulations and the posting of relevant and accurate dietary information.</p>
<p id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_fs-idm186439680">Finally, an analysis of the food supply chain must also include an awareness of people&#8217;s food needs and preferences. For example, the fact that growing numbers of consumers are adopting vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or non&#8211;genetically modified organism diets is now apparent at responsive restaurants, grocery stores, and employer-provided caf&#233;s. For many, the ethical treatment of animals remains a philosophic issue; however, some rules about what foods are morally acceptable and how they are prepared for consumption (e.g., halal or kosher) are also grounded in faith, so animal rights have religious implications, too.</p>
<p id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_fs-idm209169760">All in all, consumers&#8217; growing ethical sensitivity about what we eat could ultimately transform agribusiness. More acreage might be assigned to growing fruits and vegetables relative to those given over to livestock grazing, for instance. Or revelations about slaughterhouse processes may reduce our acceptance of the ways in which meat is processed for consumption. The economic consequences for agribusiness of such changes are difficult to underestimate.</p>

<p id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_fs-idm197556272">Peter Singer is an Australian-born philosopher who has teaching appointments at Princeton University and Monash University in Australia. His book <em data-effect="italics">Animal Liberation</em>, originally published in 1975 but revised many times since, serves as a sort of bible for the animal rights movement. Yet Singer is highly controversial because he argues that some humans have fewer cognitive skills than some animals. Therefore, if we determine what we eat on the basis of sentience (the ability to think and/or feel pain), then many animals we eat should be off limits. Watch <a href="https://openstax.org/l/53PeterSinger">Singer&#8217;s talk, &#8220;The Ethics of What We Eat,&#8221; which was recorded at Williams College in December 2009</a> as an introduction to Singer&#8217;s philosophy.</p>

Alternatives include the use of patient-drug databases, virtual drug trials, computer models and simulations, and noninvasive imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_rf-001" id="684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77-endNote44"><sup class="os-end-note-number">44</sup></a> Other techniques, such as microdosing, use humans not as test animals but as a means to improve the accuracy and reliability of test results.

Rather, companies test formulations on animals in an attempt to protect themselves from liability if a consumer is harmed by a product. However, a significant amount of new research shows that consumer products such as cosmetics can be accurately tested for safety without the abuse of animals. Some companies may resist altering their methods of conducting research, but a growing number are now realizing that their customers are demanding a change.</p>

<p id="auto_e0d50c28-f084-4d80-a1a1-89d20fd47a72_fs-idm265732240">A diverse workforce yields many positive outcomes for a company. Access to a deep pool of talent, positive customer experiences, and strong performance are all documented positives. Diversity may also bring some initial challenges, and some employees can be reluctant to see its advantages, but committed managers can deal with these obstacles effectively and make diversity a success through inclusion.</p>

<p id="auto_7575d025-fb89-4216-b191-7ff09ef9ca36_fs-idm208744256">To accommodate religious beliefs, the absence of formal religious faith, or disabilities, businesses should make every reasonable accommodation they can to allow workers to contribute to the company. This may require scheduling flexibility, the use of special devices, or simply an understanding manager.</p>

<p id="auto_9ec5dede-01c1-4b1b-b6c8-1f8345c5b820_fs-idm248875568">Although about half the states prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in private and public workplaces and a few do so in public workplaces only, federal law does not. Successful companies will not only follow the applicable law but also develop ethical policies to send a clear message that they are interested in job skills and abilities, not sexual orientation or personal life choices.</p>

<p id="auto_8adedf9c-f2a3-407c-a464-fdfc65eeb4fe_fs-idm256149216">Income inequality has grown sharply while the U.S. middle class, though vital to economic growth, has continued to shrink. Currently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, and many states simply follow the federal lead in establishing their own minimums. Though some economists dispute the existence of a simple, direct link between a shrinking middle class and governmental failure to raise the minimum wage at a sufficiently rapid pace, no one denies that businesses themselves could take the lead here by paying a higher minimum wage. Companies also can commit to hire workers as employees rather than as independent contractors and pay the cost of their benefits, and to pay women the same as men for similar work.</p>

<p id="auto_684a644e-e272-44ba-911f-4ff19cae5d77_fs-idm176509584">Mainstream businesses from pharmaceutical and medical companies to grocers and restaurants must all consider the growing public awareness of the ethical treatment of nonhuman animals. This evolving concern has particular consequences for agribusiness in terms of what creatures we consider appropriate to cultivate and eat. Cosmetic companies are increasingly subject to legislative mandates in the global marketplace and to consumer pressure at home to adopt ethical policies with regard to animal testing. An aware consuming public can continue to force improvements in our treatment of animals.</p>

<p id="auto_d217a0e2-eeae-4e67-8fbd-b9bf7751fd24_fs-idm372986336">As consumers, employees, and community members, we see everywhere the extent to which business can contribute to either social well-being or harm. Some career paths invite special scrutiny because of their influential role in society and the extent to which they serve as magnets for business students. Friends and critics of these professions have studied the unique ethical issues they raise and individuals who pursue careers in these fields should give careful consideration to these findings to decide if the benefits outweigh the potential downsides.</p>



<p id="auto_d217a0e2-eeae-4e67-8fbd-b9bf7751fd24_fs-idm361003152">Entrepreneurship, for instance, offers the opportunity to construct your own business in the hope of profit, but at some personal and financial cost. Are the potential gains being overplayed when, in fact, most entrepreneurial businesses fail? Advertising is the driver of sales, but are its claims honest and its delivery platforms, including social media, acting in good faith? Do they exert undue or biased influence on the gullible and the young? Insurance is necessary, but what is the proper and ethical role of property insurers, for example, in the face of increasingly dangerous natural disasters? Health care in the United States is extraordinarily expensive, especially compared with that in other industrialized nations, and access is too often limited to those with means. Should quality health care be a right for all rather than a privilege for the few?</p>

The entrepreneur may have to find the money required for this venture and typically draws on business experience gained by working for others first. Entrepreneurship often requires hard work, but the potential for economic payoff and career satisfaction appeals to many.</p>

<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm343945840">Although the risk of failure associated with starting a business is real and even high, we hear much in the media about success stories and little about those entrepreneurs who crash and burn. Perhaps the allure of entrepreneurship inevitably outshines any mention of the downside. Still, start-ups impose a higher than normal degree of risk, and we turn to the evidence for this now.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_56024">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm360761024">What is the specific nature of entrepreneurial risk? Different studies yield different results, but business consultant Patrick Henry reported that &#8220;75 percent of venture-backed startups fail.&#8221; Henry added that &#8220;this statistic is based on a Harvard Business School study by Shikhar Ghosh. In a study by Statistical Brain, &#8216;Startup Business Failure Rate by Industry,&#8217; the failure rate of all U.S. companies after five years was over 50 percent, and over 70 percent after ten years.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_rf-001" id="a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65-endNote1"><sup class="os-end-note-number">1</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm363701104">This figure might be enough to chill the enthusiasm of any would-be entrepreneur who believes an exciting or novel concept is enough to support a successful company with a minimal amount of time and effort and a great deal of other people&#8217;s money. Still, the ranks of start-ups expand prodigiously each month in the United States.</p>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm339578464">Even start-ups that beat the odds financially need to be watchful for a different sort of pitfall, an ethical failure that can be nourished by the very strengths that allow a company to get off the ground. That pitfall is the hubris or excessive pride that may characterize some entrepreneurs, particularly after they have had some initial success. Uber, an application-based, ride-hailing service, was founded in San Francisco by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp in 2009. If ever an idea matched the success potential of smartphones, it was this one. Offering a cheaper and more convenient service than hailing a cab on city streets, Uber was valued at $70 billion in 2017 and operated, with varying degrees of success, in seventy countries at that point. However, the corporate culture, especially at headquarters, left many observers aghast in early 2017 after an Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, blogged about her experiences there. Other employees substantiated much of her account, revealing an atmosphere rife with misogyny, homophobia, and sexual harassment.</p>

<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm350590592">Yet the workplace culture that prevailed during his years at the company was not unique to Uber. Many firms have experienced it. Holding destructive egos in check is an ethical challenge at many successful businesses, particularly at hard-riding start-ups. Founders and their start-up teams need to be aware of how deeply their attitudes toward others; their visible treatment of employees, customers, and clients; and their display of fairness will come to shape the company they are building. It is not enough for the founders to hypothesize, &#8220;we&#8217;ll get around to establishing the right protocols after we&#8217;re solvent.&#8221; Nor is it adequate to insist that standards of courteous business practice will naturally emerge on their own. An initial culture either of ethics or its absence will set a tone from the first day of business. If the founders believe these niceties are not required of them owing to their genius or confidence, such arrogance will displace ethics as a best practice. To believe otherwise is self-deception.</p>

<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm331095840">A legendary example of a start-up that still inspires many today is the Hewlett-Packard Corporation (HP). Its origins lie in the efforts of Bill Hewlett and David Packard, two Stanford University classmates in the 1930s. Much like members of a garage band, they started their company in a real garage, and the firm has outgrown its humble beginnings many times over (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_OSX_Ethics_09_01_HPGarage">Figure 9.2</a>).</p>

<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm348617552">Start-ups are exciting. Many of their founders, like the late Steve Jobs of Apple, attain near-rock star status, and the companies <em data-effect="italics">can</em> generate enormous profit. They allow many to do what they have always wanted to do and be their own bosses. Yet we often overlook the fact that even some of the most successful entrepreneurs experience many failures before they succeed, and long hours of hard work are typically required even for these failures. Smart entrepreneurs learn from their failures, but each lesson can be painful, frustrating, and time consuming.</p>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm354923888">A unique personality is required to weather the stresses and strains of a start-up, and it is a personality that tolerates much personal deprivation as it pursues the perceived highest goal of all, success for the firm, no matter what personal or collective costs might be entailed. The culture of entrepreneurialism allows for many business leaders and their staffs to be deprived of a portion of their humanity along the way to success. Thus, a preeminent ethical consideration is whether the result justifies this cost. At the very least, determined entrepreneurs must be advised of these possible sacrifices. They constitute the collateral damage of entrepreneurial dreams that any ambitious start-up founder should contemplate. Will one emerge at the end of the process as the sort of person one most wishes to be?</p>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm358111104">Even if a start-up becomes what its founders wish it to be&#8212;astronomically successful&#8212;inevitably it will change as it grows, acquires new locations, and hires more employees. These changes may eventually produce an organization with added layers&#8212;essentially, a hardened bureaucracy that slows down and complicates the management process. The company may no longer make essential decisions with the speed and nimbleness that once were possible. In short, success for a start-up is often accompanied by the risk of becoming, over time, exactly the traditional business structure its founders once rejected. So the founders of an entrepreneurial shop, and their successors, must guard against change that radically alters the original spirit of innovation and the free and rapid flow of information, even as the company grows. No business leader seeks bureaucracy, but it typically accompanies growth within any organization.</p>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm346458896">Particular problems that arise out of bureaucratization are additional layers of management, more codified procedures, and internal obstructions that surface as a business attempts to capitalize on its initial success. As more employees are added to the mix, the original team&#8217;s sense of common purpose can become diluted.</p>

Finally, he included this acknowledgement of the permanence of bureaucracy: &#8220;Once it is firmly established, bureaucracy is among those social structures which are the hardest to destroy.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_rf-005" id="a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65-endNote5"><sup class="os-end-note-number">5</sup></a></c:para>

Lutzker confirmed Weber&#8217;s testimony on the inevitability of bureaucracy: &#8220;The administrative function has of course been a pervasive element of all societies, ancient, medieval, and modern, but Weber was among the first to recognize the distinctive character of bureaucracy in the modern era.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_rf-006" id="a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65-endNote6"><sup class="os-end-note-number">6</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm371851856">Simply put, the very same success that permits a start-up to flourish often produces bureaucratic structures that chip away at the free-flowing camaraderie that allowed a handful of founders to act instantly and with one mind. As the staff expands, employees&#8217; ranks become more defined, titles and hierarchies appear, and individual achievements become harder to spot. This is what changes within a successful start-up, and it moves the company away from the more congenial atmosphere that characterized it at its outset. An original small partnership often becomes a corporate behemoth, and it takes on many of the attributes of those cubicle workplaces that frequently inspired its founders to strike out on their own in the first place.</p>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm373682080">All the better, then, if ethical practices that permit coworkers to bond as colleagues with a sense of commitment to each other and to their customers or clients emerge through a company&#8217;s trial-and-error experience at the outset. Only if the founders and initial staff emphasize treating all stakeholders with honesty, courtesy, and respect will the new firm stand a chance of indelibly cementing ethics into its operating matrix.</p>

<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm332472704">A fairly common characteristic of successful start-ups is charismatic, driven founders with take-no-prisoner competitive mentalities, as was illustrated earlier in this chapter in the example of Kalanick and the leadership values at Uber. After all, it takes a thick skin and powerful ego to get through the inevitable disappointments that confront a start-up leader. Often, however, even when these self-assured personalities evade the most egregious behavior of a Kalanick, they still remain very difficult for others to abide. Many companies discover that a different leadership ethos is necessary as they grow. Could entrepreneurs still succeed if they also embraced a humanistic leadership style at the outset, or would this invariably undermine the already low initial odds of success? It is a difficult problem with which many firms wrestle. Dedicated employees may be put off by demanding leaders who are harsh, giving little back to loyal workers even after achieving success. New employees may decide the working climate is less congenial than they anticipated and simply leave. This turnstile effect of workers voting on management with their feet constitutes an ethical judgment of repugnant leadership at the top.</p>
<div class="link-to-learning" data-type="note" id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm350398176"><h3 class="os-title" data-type="title"><span class="os-title-label">Link to Learning</span></h3><div class="os-note-body">
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm336266400">Although no single set of traits identifies the ideal start-up leader, a demanding, driven nature is a fairly common characteristic. Consider these brief profiles of entrepreneurs: first, a <a href="https://openstax.org/l/53WaltDisney">profile on Walt Disney</a> and then a <a href="https://openstax.org/l/53SteveJobs">profile on Steve Jobs</a> as well as this <a href="https://openstax.org/l/53KerrieLaird">video showing a contrasting view from Kerrie Laird</a> at Vodafone.</p>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm347364320">After watching the videos, consider this thought experiment: Suppose the cult of the charismatic&#8212;but dogmatic&#8212;entrepreneurial leader such as Walt Disney or Steve Jobs were replaced with one steeped in a commitment to employee empowerment that Kerrie Laird claims for Vodafone? Could this change the culture at start-ups? If it could, do you believe that change would be for the better or worse?</p>

This is a combination of personality and management style often identified with those business leaders who strike out on their own, bring a start-up to life, and shape its initial business practices and culture on the job. If the enterprise is successful, the principles and philosophy of the founder become enshrined in the lore of the company, so that long after his or her departure, succeeding leaders find themselves beholden to the management philosophy exemplified from the early days of the firm.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_rf-007" id="a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65-endNote7"><sup class="os-end-note-number">7</sup></a> As <em data-effect="italics">you</em> seek the right leadership style to implement on the job, begin by asking precisely what kind of leader you would prefer to work for if you were not the boss. The answer you provide may very well be the best model to follow as you develop your own leadership personality, whether it is at a start-up or a more established company.</c:para>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm350108400">The first employees of a start-up realize what is at stake as the company tiptoes into new entrepreneurial waters. The founder may be the boss, but those associated with him or her sense a collaborative spirit that directly joins them to the founder as well as each other. There can be a genuine fraternity among those who have been with the firm since day 1 or shortly thereafter. Founding members of an entrepreneurial business are also often willing to undergo the strains and rigors attached to a start-up in return for an ownership stake in the company that allows them to profit handsomely from its later growth and success.</p>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm336943152">Newer staff, however, may not share this mindset. They may simply be seeking a secure position with a growing business rather than a chance to get in on the ground floor of a risky start-up. They will not necessarily have the tolerance for the demanding hours, chaos, and abrasive personalities that can characterize the early days of an enterprise. Can entrepreneurial founders shape a company&#8217;s culture so it can accommodate talented employees who are looking for a corporate culture that supports some work&#8211;life balance?</p>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm354890464">Consider also the ethical practices of an entrepreneur and the ethical expectations of employees. Suppose that one of the distinguishing features woven into the fabric of the start-up is the respect extended to customers or clients. An entrepreneur typically promises always to hold customers in the highest regard, never lie to them, and serve them well. Furthermore, suppose this entrepreneur successfully instills this same ethos among all employees from the outset. Respect for customers is intended to become a distinguishing feature of the business; even if it causes monetary loss to the company, this entrepreneur will not cheat a client or misrepresent the company&#8217;s services. Finally, presume that this ethos is embedded into the culture of the company while it is still in start-up mode.</p>
<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm347226640">Now, and literally against the odds, suppose the company becomes successful. This may signal the hardest time of all for the entrepreneur. Growth often accompanies success, and growth means, among other things, more employees. Not all these new hires will be as committed to the same degree of responsibility for customers. They will not necessarily set out to cheat clients, but they might lack the founder&#8217;s enthusiasm for the most honorable treatment of customers. How can an entrepreneur ensure that the initial commitment carries over to the second generation of leadership? He or she cannot simply order it to happen&#8212;human nature usually does not respond so easily. So entrepreneurs must do their best to ensure that their version of customer service, one that prioritizes respect for clients, is passed along to new employees. It may be ingrained in the longest-serving employees, but it must be nurtured to the point where it has the same significance for the newest hires. This is where leadership mettle is tested to the severest degree.</p>

He called it &#8220;Kinko&#8217;s&#8221; after his own nickname and, with his partners, he sold college school supplies and around-the-clock copying services for students. After twenty-five years, Kinko&#8217;s had grown to 1,200 stores and 23,000 employees, and Orfalea privately and lucratively sold it to FedEx.</p>

Long hours, of course, but also the need he felt to sustain his initial success, to make each year more profitable than the last.

Because as consumers we need and want to be informed, this feature of advertising is to the good. Yet some advertising is intended to lead to the purchase of goods and services we do not need. Some ads may make claims containing only the thinnest slice of truth or exaggerate and distort what the goods and services can actually deliver. All these tactics raise serious ethical concerns that we will consider here.</p>

Social media platforms have evolved to symbolize the status of both individuals and businesses alike. . .

For those who derive most of the significant information that shapes their lives solely through electronic sources, nothing other than social media&#8211;based appeals stands much chance of influencing their purchasing decisions.</p>

It provides lightning-quick access to potential customers, but it also opens pathways for sensitive corporate and consumer data to be hacked on an alarming scale.

<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm310610624">By definition, advertising aims to persuade consumers to buy goods and services, many of which are nonessential. Although consumers have long been encouraged to heed the warning caveat emptor (let the buyer beware), it is a valid question whether advertisers have any ethical obligation to rein in the oft-exaggerated claims of their marketing pitches. Most consumers emphatically would agree that they do.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_86554">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm309413360">The award-winning Harvard University economist John Kenneth Galbraith directly addressed this issue in <em data-effect="italics">The Affluent Society</em>, first published in 1958. In what he depicted as the &#8220;the dependence effect,&#8221; Galbraith bemoaned the power of corporations to harness wide-ranging advertising strategies, marketing efforts, and sales pitches to influence consumer purchasing decisions.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_rf-005" id="20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b-endNote15"><sup class="os-end-note-number">15</sup></a> He asked whether it is possible for a sophisticated advertising campaign to create a demand for a product whose benefits are frivolous at best. If so, is there anything inherently wrong with that? Or are informed consumers themselves responsible for resisting tempting&#8212;though misleading&#8212;advertising claims and exercising their own best judgment about whether to buy a product that might be successful, not because it deserves to be but simply because of the marketing hype behind it? These questions remain fundamental to the manager&#8217;s task of creating ethical advertising campaigns in which truthful content is prioritized over inducing wasteful consumption.</c:para>
<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm501496192">Psychological appeals form the basis of the most successful ads. Going beyond the standard ad pitch about the product&#8217;s advantages, <span data-type="term" id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_term243" group-by="p">psychological appeal</span><strong data-effect="bold">s</strong> try to reach our self-esteem and persuade us that we will feel better about ourselves if we use certain products. If advertising frames the purchase of a popular toy as the act of a loving parent rather than an extravagance, for instance, consumers may buy it not because their child needs it but because it makes them feel good about what generous parents they are. This is how psychological appeals become successful, and when they do work, this often constitutes a victory for the power of psychological persuasion at the expense of ethical truthfulness.</p>
<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm311600800">Purchases are also affected by our notion of what constitutes a necessity versus a luxury, and that perception often differs across generations. Older consumers today can probably remember when a cell phone was considered a luxury, for instance, rather than a necessity for every schoolchild. On the other hand, many younger consumers consider the purchase of a landline unnecessary, whereas some older people still use a conventional phone as their main or even preferred means of communication. The cars and suburban homes that were once considered essential purchases for every young family are slowly becoming luxuries, replaced, for many millennials, by travel. Generational differences like these are carefully studied by advertisers who are anxious to make use of psychological appeals in their campaigns.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_679">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm324722128">A consumer craze based on little more than novelty&#8212;or, at least, not on necessity or luxury in the conventional sense&#8212;is the Pet Rock, a recurring phenomenon that began in 1977. Pet Rocks have been purchased by the millions over the years, despite being nothing more than rocks. During the 2017 holiday shopping season, they retailed at $19.95.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_rf-006" id="20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b-endNote16"><sup class="os-end-note-number">16</sup></a> Is this a harmless fad, or a rip-off of gullible consumers who are persuaded it can satisfy a real need? In the annals of marketing, the Pet Rock craze denotes one of the most successful campaigns&#8212;still unfolding today, though in subdued fashion&#8212;in support of so dubious a product.</c:para>
<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm305431136">As long as marketers refrain from breaking the law or engaging in outright lies, are they still acting ethically in undertaking influential advertising campaigns that may drive gullible consumers to purchase products with minimal usefulness? Is this simply the free market in operation? In other words, are manufacturers just supplying a product, promoting it, and then seeing whether customers respond positively to it? Or are savvy marketing campaigns exerting too much influence on consumers ill prepared to resist them? Many people have long asked exactly these questions, and we still have arrived at no clear consensus as to how to answer them. Yet it remains an obligation of each new generation of marketers to reflect on these points and, at the very least, establish their convictions about them.</p>
<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm338505392">A second ethical question is how we should expect reasonable people to respond to an avalanche of marketing schemes deliberately intended to separate them from their hard-earned cash. Are consumers obligated to sift through all the messages and ultimately make purchasing decisions in their own best interest? For example, does a perceived &#8220;deal&#8221; on an unhealthy food option justify the purchase (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_OSX_Ethics_09_02_JunkFood">Figure 9.3</a>)? These questions have no consensus answers, but they underlie any discussion of the point at which sophisticated advertising runs headlong into people&#8217;s obligation to take responsibility for the wisdom of their purchases.</p>

Generally, young children have not developed sufficient judgment to know what advertised products are good for them and which ones have little or no benefit or perhaps can even harm. Research has even shown that very young children have difficulty separating what is real on television from what is not. This is especially so as it pertains to advertising for junk food. Savvy marketers take advantage of the fact that young children (those younger than age seven or eight years) view advertising in the same manner they do information from trustworthy adults&#8212;that is, as very credible&#8212;and so marketers hone pitches for junk food directly to these children.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_rf-007" id="20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b-endNote17"><sup class="os-end-note-number">17</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm324647216">What restrictions could we reasonably impose on those who gear their ads toward children? We could argue that they should take special care that ads targeting children make absolutely no exaggerated claims, because children are less capable of seeing through the usual puffery that most of us ignore. Children are more literal, and once they gain the ability to understand messages directed toward them, especially when voiced by adult authority figures, they typically accept these as truthful statements.</p>
<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm495367520">When adults make poor consumer choices, who is responsible? Is it ourselves? Is it our society and culture, which permit the barrage of marketing to influence us in ways we often come to regret? Is it the persuasive power of marketers, which we should rein in through law? Do adults have the right to some assistance from marketers as they attempt to carry out their responsibility to protect children from manipulative ads? We have no easy answers to these questions, though they have taken on special urgency as technology has expanded the range of advertising even to our smartphones.</p>

<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm327510720">It may be possible for marketing to be unfairly persuasive in ways that overwhelm the better judgment of consumers. Whether it is the consumers&#8217; responsibility to resist or marketers&#8217; to tone down their appeals, or both, will continue to be debated. Yet the question of where responsibility lies when consumers are steered to make choices certainly has ethical ramifications.</p>
<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm308162224">Some psychologists and educational specialists claim that the very old and the very young are particularly ill prepared to exercise good judgment in the face of <span data-type="term" id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_term244" group-by="s">subliminal advertising</span>, that is, embedded words or images that allegedly reach us only beneath the level of our consciousness. Other experts, however, disagree and insist that subliminal advertising is an urban myth that no current technology could create or sustain.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_39407">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm352549616">A U.S. journalist, Vance Packard, published <em data-effect="italics">The Hidden Persuaders</em> in 1957, contending that subliminal messaging had already been introduced into some U.S. cinemas to sell more refreshments at the theaters&#8217; snack bars. Alarms sounded at the prospect, but it turned out that any data on which Packard was relying came from James Vicary, a U.S. market researcher who insisted he had engineered the feat in a cinema in New Jersey. No other substantiation was provided, and Vicary&#8217;s claim was eventually dismissed as self-promotion, which he seemed to concede in an interview five years later. Although the immediate threat of subliminal advertising receded, some people remain concerned that such persuasion might indeed be possible, especially with the advent of better technologies, like virtual reality, to implement it.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_rf-008" id="20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b-endNote18"><sup class="os-end-note-number">18</sup></a></c:para>

After that window of time passed, however, any impact of subliminal messaging receded.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_rf-009" id="20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b-endNote19"><sup class="os-end-note-number">19</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm496306944">So the scientific evidence establishing any real phenomenon of subliminal advertising is inconclusive. Put another way, the evidence to this point does not definitively demonstrate the existence of a current technology making subliminal marketing pitches possible. Given this, it cannot be clearly determined whether such a technology, if it did exist, would be effective. Another question is whether virtual reality and augmented reality might eventually make subliminal advertising viable. Real subliminal persuasion might render children, the elderly, and those with developmental disabilities more vulnerable to falling prey. Could even the most skeptical viewer resist a message so powerfully enhanced that the product can be sampled without leaving home? Would you be in favor of federal government regulation to prevent such ads? What sort of ethical imperatives would you be willing to request of or impose on sophisticated marketers?</p>

Even the exaggerated claims that often accompany ads can serve a purpose as long as we do not unquestioningly accept every pitch as true.</p>

Merchants sought a means to limit their financial losses in the event their cargoes were lost at sea.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_20744">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm365453504">In England, merchants and shippers gathered together in associations, or syndicates, to distribute the risk of loss as evenly as possible. For a fee, individual merchants and ships&#8217; owners in these syndicates could buy insurance, essentially the right to be financially compensated by the syndicate&#8217;s fund for their loss if their shipments or vessels sank. The first such association of traders and shippers began at Samuel Lloyd&#8217;s coffee house, on Tower Street near the River Thames, in 1688. This was the origin of the huge insurance market now known as Lloyd&#8217;s of London,<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_rf-001" id="cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18-endNote20"><sup class="os-end-note-number">20</sup></a> and from these early forms of group insurance sprang the profession as it exists today.</c:para>
<p id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_fs-idm331303776">From the seventeenth century to the present, the profession has faced a fundamental ethical quandary: An insurance company makes money when purchaser fees, called <span data-type="term" id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_term246" group-by="p">premiums</span>, are numerous and <span data-type="term" id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_term247" group-by="c">claim</span><strong data-effect="bold">s</strong>, requests for monetary compensation for covered losses, are few. But the reality is that accidents occur, whether they take the form of shipping losses, vehicular collisions, or home or business fires. So insurance carriers set customer premiums at a high enough rate to compensate themselves with a baseline profit when claims for compensation arise. The ethical question then is what constitutes a <em data-effect="italics">reasonable</em> profit. The way the industry defines &#8220;reasonable&#8221; is directly reflected in the premiums it sets, which also take into account actuarial and statistical calculations of the historic frequency of the occurrence of various claims.</p>

<p id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_fs-idm359281856">The irony of insurance coverage of any sort is that we buy it hoping never to use it. Still, business and consumers alike appreciate that a catastrophic loss can be financially devastating and so they seek to protect against it. Insurance coverage does not prevent illness, accidents, or other unforeseen events from occurring, but it does offer a means to recover, at least partially, from the monetary costs associated with them.</p>
<p id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_fs-idm347177872">Insurance policies constitute a form of contract between insurers and the insured. To reduce their losses in those situations in which they must pay on a claim, insurers do their best to attach high premiums to the coverage and identify exclusions and limits on it. They worry about being forced to pay out on frivolous and exaggerated claims, while policyholders fear that on the rare occasions when they will have to file a claim, their reimbursement will be minuscule and/or their future premiums will rise. From the perspective of the consumer, the guarantee of a fair payout on a claim is the only inducement to pay insurance premiums in the first place.</p>

Your business is located in a blighted area of town where the jobs you provide are important, but the insurance costs of doing business there are significant, too. Recently, fire and theft coverage has escalated in cost, but it is essential to protect your premises and inventory, and local ordinances require that you purchase it. You have customarily provided health coverage for your employees and their families, which many of them would not be able to afford if they had to bear the cost themselves. You would like to continue providing this coverage&#8212;though, due to your small employee base, you are not legally obligated to do so&#8212;but these costs have risen too. Finally, you would prefer to stay in this location, because you feel an obligation to your workers, most of whom live nearby, and because you feel welcomed by the community itself, which includes some longtime customers. Still, you may be forced to choose between paying for your employee health care costs and moving to a different area of town where fire and theft coverage would not cost as much.</p>

In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey dumped fifty-two inches of rain on Houston, Texas, accompanied by fierce winds. Tens of thousands of homes, stores, factories, and other industrial sites suffered severe damage and flooding. Although normal homeowners&#8217; and business owners&#8217; insurance provides for loss due to hurricane winds, it does not cover loss due to flooding. As <em data-effect="italics">The Economist</em> observed in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, &#8220;whereas wind damage is covered under most standard insurance policies in America, flood insurance is a government-run add-on that far from all homeowners buy. As a result, of over $30 billion in property losses in Texas, only 40 percent may be insured.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_rf-002" id="cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18-endNote21"><sup class="os-end-note-number">21</sup></a></c:para>

After all, most insurance carriers are for-profit, and companies would make little money insuring everyone against flood damage in flood-prone areas. It would be a losing proposition for any carrier to undertake, because insurance companies enjoy their highest returns when claims are few and payouts small. But the federal government is not a commercial broker and does not intend to make a profit from extending any sort of insurance coverage. For that reason, the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 established a way to dispense flood coverage through a federal agency. Today that supervising agency is the Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA), in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_OSX_Ethics_09_04_FloodInsur">Figure 9.4</a>).

<p id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_fs-idm336406192">We do not know with certainty what effect climate change will have on the incidence or severity of natural disasters (i.e., accidents that do not appear to have any direct human cause). We do know, however, that these events can be ruinously expensive, for the carriers that insure against them and for those who suffer them and must put their lives back together afterward.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_90407">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm332298160">Business writer Don Jergler said, for example, that &#8220;climate change has created a &#8216;wildfire crisis in California,&#8217; which in turn is &#8216;causing a fire insurance predicament.&#8217;&#8221; California insurance commissioner Dave Jones warned in December 2017, after a particularly disastrous fire season in California, that &#8220;insurers may start to back off writing insurance in some areas [of the state],&#8221; and this would pose a crisis for homeowners who consequently lost insurance protection against losses caused by wildfires.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_rf-004" id="cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18-endNote23"><sup class="os-end-note-number">23</sup></a></c:para>

This unwillingness, in turn, would deny coverage against these disasters to an increasing number of individuals and companies. The high cost of disaster claims and subsequent shrinking of policy offerings are losses first experienced by the insurance industry, but they have rapid and dire consequences for policyholders.</p>
<p id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_fs-idm336240080">Again, we come to the ethical conundrum as to what we might fairly expect from insurance carriers and from clients who seek to indemnify themselves against natural disasters. In regions where certain kinds of disasters are more likely to occur, is it reasonable to dictate that carriers still must provide coverage? If so, should we consider extending public subsidies to the carriers to protect them against catastrophic payouts? Should premiums be assigned on the basis of the incidence patterns and severity of risk associated with particular disasters in certain regions? With these questions, we return to the ethical consideration of what constitutes a reasonable profit for carriers and what premium policy holders ought to be charged for sufficient coverage.</p>

It is often a successful partnership. When we consider the scale of loss that can result from natural disasters, and the extent of the public&#8217;s need for protection from such loss, insurance may be a U.S. industry in which private/public ownership of some policies would be appropriate. The National Flood Insurance Program and the California Earthquake Authority are rare examples of public agencies managing insurance coverage that private insurers have declined to provide because the potential for profit is too low. Whether partnerships like this can and should be expanded, and whether they can be funded from federal and state budgets, are ethical questions for federal and state governments and policyholders alike.</c:para>

As an example, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated, headquartered in Minnesota, had about $185 million in sales in 2017 and employed approximately 230,000 people. Still, as an industry report from the business research company Hoovers established, insurers of all stripes, health or auto or property or anything else, face two major hurdles. First, they &#8220;are increasingly subject to a large number of regulations and reporting requirements by states. Consequently, some insurers have withdrawn from states that impose burdensome requirements.&#8221; Second, large-scale &#8220;claims have become more common, creating problematic concentrations of risk for individual insurers. . . . And some risks can be large enough to drive insurers out of business or cause them to curtail services offered, increase rates, or leave states where risk is highest.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_rf-007" id="cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18-endNote26"><sup class="os-end-note-number">26</sup></a> Thus, profits can be high within the industry, but so can payouts in the aftermath of major catastrophes.

<p id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_fs-idm350537200">A specific ethical challenge within the insurance profession is the tendency to engage in <span data-type="term" id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_term248" group-by="r">redlining</span>. Redlining is the practice of assigning or denying coverage for certain policies, such as auto, homeowners, or business insurance, on the basis of the geographic neighborhoods where applicants for such coverage live, particularly inner-city neighborhoods. A variation on the practice is to charge considerably higher prices for the same coverage in different neighborhoods. Redlining assumes that the propensity for accidents, burglaries, fires, and other catastrophes is higher in some areas than others, so claims and costs will be higher for the insurance carrier.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_72321">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm331343168">At first glance, this practice appears to make economic sense from the perspective of both the insurer and the insured. Looking beneath the surface, however, reveals that redlined neighborhoods are often areas where racial and ethnic minorities live. No insurance carrier ever admits to engaging in discriminatory redlining (the term refers to an older practice by which insurance companies marked certain neighborhoods in red on print copies of coverage maps). Nearly every state in the United States forbids the practice. Yet a comprehensive 2017 study by <em data-effect="italics">Consumer Reports</em> and ProPublica, a nonprofit research organization, indicated the phenomenon may remain very much a reality. This study focused on rates for auto insurance and found that for &#8220;decades, auto insurers have been observed to charge higher average premiums to drivers living in predominantly minority urban neighborhoods than to drivers with similar safety records living in majority white neighborhoods. Insurers have long defended their pricing by saying that the risk of accidents is greater in those neighborhoods, even for motorists who have never had one.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_rf-009" id="cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18-endNote28"><sup class="os-end-note-number">28</sup></a></c:para>

They contended &#8220;that many of the disparities in auto insurance prices between minority and white neighborhoods are wider than differences in risk can explain.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_rf-010" id="cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18-endNote29"><sup class="os-end-note-number">29</sup></a> This is significant because laws do typically permit premium rates to be set according to the incidence of claims filed within certain neighborhoods. Yet laws never allow rates to be based solely or predominantly on the race or ethnicity of the residents in different neighborhoods. This is the essence of prohibited redlining. Professionals in the industry do well to steer clear of this practice or even the appearance of it, and that is the overriding theme of this study.</c:para>
<p id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_fs-idm339534272">Drawing back, the ethical challenge for any responsible carrier is to ensure that the race, ethnicity, or creed of any policyholder plays absolutely no role in the premiums assigned him or her. There is no defensible reason to base a carrier&#8217;s decision to extend or deny insurance coverage or assign the premium amount for it on these factors.</p>

This model for rationing health services is rare in the developed world and stands in dramatic contrast to the provision of health care in other industrialized economies. Those who provide health care and administer the health care system find that balancing the quality of, access to, and cost of medical care is an ethical dilemma in which they must continually engage.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-001" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote30"><sup class="os-end-note-number">30</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm308639072">Typically in the United States, medical services have been dispensed through a <span data-type="term" id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_term249" group-by="m">multipayer health care system</span>, in which the patient and others, such as an employer and a private health insurance company, all contribute to pay for the patient&#8217;s care. Germany, France, and Japan also have multipayer systems. In a <span data-type="term" id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_term250" group-by="s">single-payer health care system</span> such as those in the United Kingdom and Canada, national tax revenues pay the largest portion of citizens&#8217; medical care, and the government is the sole payer compensating those who provide that care. Contributions provided by employers and employees provide the rest. Both single- and multipayer systems help reduce costs for patients, employers, and insurers; both, especially single-payer, are also heavily dependent on taxes apportioned across employers and the country&#8217;s population. In a single-payer system, however, because payment for health care is coordinated and dispensed by the government, almost no one lacks access to medical services, including visitors and nonpermanent residents.</p>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm306626800">Many reasons exist for the predominance of the multipayer system in the United States. Chief among these is the U.S. tradition that doctors&#8217; services and hospital care are privatized and run for profit. The United States has no federal health care apparatus that organizes physicians, clinics, and medical centers under a single government umbrella. Along with the profit motive, the fact that providers are compensated at a higher average rate than their peers abroad ensures that health care is more expensive in the United States than in most other nations.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_37417">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm328802816">The United States also has more health care professionals per citizen than most other countries, and more medical centers and clinics (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_OSX_Ethics_09_03_UnivMed">Figure 9.5</a>). One positive result is that the wait for most elective medical procedures is often shorter than in other countries, and travel time to a nearby medical facility is often less. Still, paying for health care remains one of the most controversial topics in the United States, and many question what it is that Americans gain from the current system to balance the cost. As an exhaustive study from The Commonwealth Fund asserted, &#8220;the United States spends far more on health care than other high-income countries, with spending levels that rose continuously over the past three decades. . . . Yet the U.S. population has poorer health than other countries.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-002" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote31"><sup class="os-end-note-number">31</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm501456848">Besides its inefficiencies, the state of U.S. health care raises challenging ethical issues for professionals in the field and for patients as well. What happens if many poorer people cannot afford health care? Should doctors treat them anyway? Who is qualified to receive subsidized (insured) health care? In the absence of universal health care, which is generally ensured elsewhere by a single-payer system that entitles everyone to receive care at very low cost, can the United States truly boast of being the richest nation on Earth? Put another way, when the least materially advantaged in a country do not have access to quality health care, what is the worth such a nation patently is assigning to those human beings residing within it?</p>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm306102800">Supporters of the status quo for health care in the United States may point to state-of-the-art facilities as evidence of its success. Yet other nations, such as Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, have equal levels of medical technologies available for patients and are given much more favorable marks for universal health insurance and accessibility by The Commonwealth Fund.</p>

According to William B. Schultz, an attorney writing in the <em data-effect="italics">Washington Post</em> in 2017, &#8220;in the past 35 years, the only significant victory in the battle to control drug prices has been the enactment of legislation that established the generic drug program at the FDA [Federal Drug Administration].&#8221; Otherwise, he stated, &#8220;prescription drug prices account for 17 percent of the nation&#8217;s health-care costs, up from 7 percent in the 1990s,&#8221; and &#8220;prescription drug spending accounts for nearly 20 percent of total program spending for Medicare, the largest of the governmental health-care programs.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-003" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote32"><sup class="os-end-note-number">32</sup></a> (Schultz is not entirely impartial; he is a partner in a law firm that represents generic drug providers, among other clients.)</c:para>

Critics, on the other hand, assert that the much of the expense incurred within the industry results from the high cost of marketing new drugs. Wherever the truth lies in this debate, it remains that exorbitant prices for much-needed medicines dramatically reduce their social value when only a few individuals can actually afford to obtain them. What does it say of our priorities if we have the technology to create life-saving medicines but allow astronomic prices effectively to deny them to many patients who require them?</p>

<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm363227744">Within the multipayer system, many U.S. workers have traditionally looked to their employers or their unions to subsidize the cost of care and thereby make it available for them and their families. Many reasons explain why this is so. In contrast to the European and Canadian perspective, for example, in which both the state and employers are presumed to have an interest in and responsibility for underwriting the cost of health care, the traditional U.S. approach is that workers and their employers should be responsible for securing this coverage. This belief reflects an unease on the part of some about assigning services to the government, because this implies the need for a larger governing entity as well as additional taxes to sustain it. The sentiment also reflects a conviction on the part of some that self-reliance is always to be preferred when securing the necessities of life.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_7813">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm307267440">John E. Murray, a professor of economics at the University of Toledo, offered a related explanation. He cited the existence of industrial sickness funds in the United States, which arose in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These were monies &#8220;organized by workers through their employer or union [that] provided the rudiments of health insurance, principally consisting of paid sick leave, to a large minority of the industrial workforce of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-004" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote33"><sup class="os-end-note-number">33</sup></a> Murray stated that these funds declined in popularity not because they were ineptly administered or rendered bankrupt by World War I or the Great Depression but rather because they gave way to even more effective instruments in the form of group insurance policies offered by employers or labor unions.</c:para>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_71212">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm307480768">So the U.S. worker&#8217;s experience differed from that of European labor in that much significant health care coverage was provided under the auspices of unions and employers rather than the state. Murray noted another source of relief for workers who experienced illness or injury that prevented them from working for any period of time, and that was charity.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-005" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote34"><sup class="os-end-note-number">34</sup></a> Specific versions of charity were offered by religious organizations, including Christian churches and Jewish synagogues. Often, these religious bodies banded together to provide monetary benefits for sick or injured members of their own faith who might otherwise have been denied health coverage due to prejudice.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-006" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote35"><sup class="os-end-note-number">35</sup></a> The U.S. social experience featured more ethnic and cultural diversity, especially in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, than was present in many European nations, and a downside is the racial, ethnic, and religious prejudice it inspired.</c:para>

Early supporters of industrial sickness funds, including some physicians, anticipated that most doctors would support these funds as pathways ultimately directed to state-provided coverage. Instead, in 1920, &#8220;the American Medical Association voted officially to state its opposition to government health insurance. A sociologist concluded that from this time to the 1960s, physicians were the loudest opponents of government insurance.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-007" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote36"><sup class="os-end-note-number">36</sup></a> By default, then, many U.S. workers came to rely more on their employers or unions than on any other source for coverage. However, this explanation does not answer the larger ethical question of who <em data-effect="italics">should</em> provide health insurance to residents and citizens, a question that continues to roil politics and society in the nation even today.</c:para>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm305438400">More recently, large corporations have moved from providing one-size-fits-all insurance plans to compiling a menu of offerings to accommodate the different needs of their employees. Workers with dependent children may opt for maximum health care coverage for their children. Employees without dependents or a partner may elect a plan without this coverage and thereby pay lower premiums (the initial cost for coverage). Yet others might minimize their health-insurance coverage and convert some of the employer costs that are freed up into added pension or retirement plan value. Employers and workers have become creative in tailoring benefit plans that best suit the needs of employees (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_OSX_Ethics_09_04_WellPoint">Figure 9.6</a>).

<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm305431136">Despite the intricacies of this customization, employers have found the group coverage policies they offer to be expensive for them too, more so with each passing year. Full health care coverage is becoming rarer as a standard employment benefit, and it is often available only to those who work full time. California, for example, stipulates that most workers need not be provided with employer health care coverage unless they work at least twenty hours a week.</p>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm302911552">Rising costs for both employers and employees have combined to leave fewer employees with health care benefits at any given time. Employees with limited or no coverage for themselves and their dependents often cope by cutting back on the medical attention they seek, even when doing so places their health at risk. Whenever workers must skip medical services due to cost considerations, this places both them and their employers in an ethical quandary, because both typically want workers to be in good health. Furthermore, when employees must deny their dependents appropriate health care, this dilemma is all the more intensified.</p>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm310508288">To try to reduce the costs to themselves of employee health care insurance coverage, some companies have instituted <span data-type="term" id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_term253" group-by="w">wellness programs</span> to try to ensure that their workforces are as healthy as possible. Some popular wellness program offerings are measures to help smokers quit, workout rooms on work premises or subsidized gym memberships, and revamped vending and cafeteria offerings that provide a range of healthier choices. Some companies even offer employees bonuses or other rewards for quitting smoking or achieving specific fitness goals such as weight loss or miles walked per week. Such employer efforts appear benign at first glance, because these measures truly can produce better health on the part of workers. Still, ethical questions arise as to who the true beneficiaries of such policies are. Is it the employees themselves or the companies for which they work? Furthermore, if such measures were to become compulsory rather than optional, would it still reflect managerial benevolence toward employees? We discuss this in the following paragraphs.</p>

Additionally, what about wellness rules that extend to workers&#8217; behavior off the job? Is it ethical for a company to assert the right to restrict the actions of its employees when they are not on the clock? Some, such as researchers Richard J. Herzog, Katie Counts McClain, and Kymberleigh R. Rigard, argue that workers surrender a degree of privacy simply by going onto payroll: &#8220;When employees enter the workplace, they forfeit external privacy. For example, BMI [body mass index] can be visually calculated, smokers can be observed, and food intake monitored.&#8221; They acknowledge, however, that &#8220;protecting privacy and enhancing productivity can provide a delicate balance.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-011" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote41"><sup class="os-end-note-number">40</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm362685568">Health care reform on a major scale emerged in the United States with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as the <span data-type="term" id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_term254" group-by="A">Affordable Care Act (ACA)</span>, in March 2010, during the Obama Administration. The ACA (so-called <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_term255" group-by="O">Obamacare</span>) represents a controversial plan that strikes its opponents as socialist. For its supporters, however, it is the first effective and comprehensive plan to extend affordable health care to the widest segment of the U.S. population. Furthermore, like most new federal policies, it has undergone tweaks and revision each year since becoming law. The ACA is funded by a combination of payments by enrollees and supplemental federal monies earmarked for this task.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_93552">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm495451904">The ACA mandates a certain level of preventive care, a choice of physicians and health care facilities, coverage at no extra cost for individuals with preexisting health conditions, protection against the cancellation of coverage solely on the basis of becoming ill, and mental health and substance abuse treatment, all of which must be met by carriers that participate in the plan. The ACA also permits its holders to select from a number of marketplace plans as opposed to the limited number of plans typically offered by any given employer.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-013" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote42"><sup class="os-end-note-number">42</sup></a> All in all, it is a far-reaching and complex plan whose full implications for employers and their employees have yet to be appreciated. Preliminary results seem to indicate that employer-provided coverage on a comprehensive scale remains a cheaper alternative for those workers eligible to receive it.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-014" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote43"><sup class="os-end-note-number">43</sup></a> Given the general efficiency of group insurance policies provided by U.S. employers, an ethical issue for all managers is whether these policies offer the best care for the greatest number of employees and so should be the responsibility of management to offer whenever it is possible to do so. Current law requires all companies employing fifty or more workers to make insurance available to that part of their workforce that qualifies for such coverage (e.g., by virtue of hours worked). Is it right, however, to leave the employees of smaller firms to their own devices in securing health care? Even if the law does not require it, we hold that an ethical obligation resides with small businesses to do everything in their power to provide this coverage for their employees.</c:para>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm340228352">Evidence of the intense debate the act has engendered is the Trump administration&#8217;s attempts, beginning in January 2017, to repeal the ACA entirely, or at least to dilute significantly many of its provisions. Nearly immediately upon his inauguration, President Trump signed Executive Order 13765 in anticipation of ending the ACA. Also that same month, the American Health Care Act was introduced in the House of Representatives, again with an eye to eliminating or seriously weakening the existing act. Much political debate within both the House and Senate ensued in 2017, with proponents of the ACA seeking to ensure its survival and opponents attempting (but, as of this writing, failing) to repeal it.</p>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm341931472">The ACA represents the first far-reaching health care coverage to take effect since 1965, after many stalled or otherwise frustrated attempts. Since the passage that year of the Medicare and Medicaid Act, which provided health coverage to retired, elderly, and indigent citizens, many presidential administrations, Democrat and Republican alike, have worked to enlarge health care coverage for different segments of the national population. In addition to expanding eligibility for benefits, the Medicare and Medicaid Act had direct implications for business proprietors and their employees. For one, the act set up new automatic earnings deductions and tax schedules for workers and employers, and employers were made responsible for administering these plans, which help fund the programs&#8217; benefits.</p>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm365934816">The future of the ACA appears to depend on whether a Democrat or Republican sits in the White House and which party controls the Senate and the House in the U.S. Congress. Although legislation does hinge on the political sentiments of the president and the majority party in Congress, what is ethical does not lend itself to a majority vote. So regardless of whether the ACA survives, is revised, or is replaced entirely by new health care legislation, the provision of health care will likely continue to pose ethical implications for U.S. business and the workers who are employed by it.</p>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm350671936">The ethical debate over universal health care coverage is larger even than business and its employees, of course, but it still carries immense consequences for management and labor irrespective of how the ACA or other legislation fares in the halls of government and the courts. An ethical dilemma for employers is the extent to which they should make health coverage available to their workers at affordable rates, particularly if federal and state government plans provide little or no coverage for residents and the costs of employer-provided coverage continues to climb.</p>

<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm326329568">Against the backdrop of federal attempts to institute national health care over the past several decades, some individual states in the United States have used their own resources to advance this issue by proposing mandated health care coverage for their citizens. For example, in April 2006, Massachusetts passed An Act Providing Access to Affordable, Quality, Accountable Heath Care, the first significant effort at the state level to ensure near-universal health care coverage.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_67624">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm339933104">The Massachusetts act created a state agency, the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, to administer the extension of health care coverage to Massachusetts residents. In many ways, it served as the most significant precursor of and guide for the federal ACA, which would follow approximately four years later. By many accounts, the Massachusetts legislation has achieved its purposes with few negative consequences. As Brian C. Mooney, reporting in the <em data-effect="italics">Boston Globe</em>, put it about five years after the act&#8217;s passage: &#8220;A detailed <em data-effect="italics">Globe</em> examination [of the implementation of the act] makes it clear that while there have been some stumbles&#8212;and some elements of the effort merit a grade of &#8216;incomplete&#8217;&#8212;the overhaul, after five years, worked as well as or better than expected.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-015" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote44"><sup class="os-end-note-number">44</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm326695200">The proposed Healthy California Act (SB 562) is another example. SB 562 passed in the California State Senate in June 2017. However, the Speaker of the Assembly, the lower house of the legislature, blocked a hearing of the bill at that time, and a hearing is necessary for the bill to advance to ratification. A new effort was initiated in February 2018 to permit the bill finally to be considered by the lower house. (Two differences between the California bill and the Massachusetts Act include the number of state residents who would be affected. Massachusetts has a population of about seven million compared to California&#8217;s nearly forty million. A second distinction is that SB 562 is constitutes a single-payer plan, whereas the Massachusetts Act does not.)</p>

California&#8217;s effort is a very simple plan on its face but complex in its implementation. Here is how Michael Hiltzik summarized the intent of California Senate Bill 562: &#8220;The program would take over responsibility for almost all medical spending in the state, including federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, employer-sponsored health plans, and Affordable Care Act plans. It would relieve employers, their workers and buyers in the individual market of premiums, deductibles and copays, paying the costs out of a state fund.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_rf-016" id="ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666-endNote45"><sup class="os-end-note-number">45</sup></a> The bill would create a large, special program apparatus tentatively entitled Healthy California. It is contentious on many fronts, particularly in that it would create the largest single-payer health insurance plan sponsored by a U.S. state and the scope of the plan would necessitate a huge bureaucracy to administer it as well an infusion of state monies to sustain it. Furthermore, it would extend health care coverage to all residents of the state, including undocumented immigrants.</c:para>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm310800608">A specific hurdle to passage of Healthy California is that it would cost anywhere from $370 billion to $400 billion and would require federal waivers so California could assume the administration of Medicare and Medicaid in the state as well as the federal funds currently allotted to it. All these conditions would be enormously difficult and time consuming to meet, even if the federal government were sympathetic to California&#8217;s attempts to do so. In 2018, that was decidedly not the case.</p>
<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm335274496">Is free or inexpensive access to health care a basic human right? If so, which elements within society bear the principal responsibility for providing it: government, business, workers, all these, or other agencies or individuals? This is a foundational ethical question that would invoke different responses on the part of nearly everyone you may ask.</p>

One article estimates that the cost of instituting a national, single-payer health care insurance program in the United States would be $32 trillion over ten years.

Precisely where these efforts will take us may not be clear for the next several years. The political, economic, and ethical dimensions of public management of our health care drive considerable controversy and very little agreement.</p>

<p id="auto_a1357f8b-51a3-4417-ad7b-8b0af54d9d65_fs-idm334122672">The atmosphere surrounding entrepreneurs and their start-ups can provide a dizzying rush. The opportunities to create a company, be your own boss, make a dramatic impact on business, establish an entrepreneurial culture that will be adopted by others, and possibly become rich in the process certainly all appeal to our human nature. Still, the entrepreneurial lifestyle is challenging, and the success rate for start-ups is exceptionally low. Interpersonal conflicts are prevalent in start-up environments, and entrepreneurs who seek to stay true to their vision and ethical values face a difficult road. At many points, start-up founders have to choose how they most wish to be remembered: for the sake of their business success alone or also for the ethical fashion in which they attained that success and the humane culture they have embedded in their new firm. Sometimes these are mutually exclusive goals, but the most ethical entrepreneurs do their best to ensure that both objectives mesh for themselves and their firms. This lies at the heart of any definition of ethical leadership.</p>

<p id="auto_20aa9863-bbb5-4bc8-b7c7-d2496f357f3b_fs-idm329623792">The Internet and social media present new canvasses for marketing that possess great power and for which rules and ethical norms are being developed. Psychological appeals and subliminal messaging present their own ethical issues. Discerning consumers currently must rely on their own sensibility to ferret out factual claims for advertised products and bear the burden of shielding those under their charge from the worst manipulative effects of marketing.</p>

<p id="auto_cd24d01c-87a1-4c49-8c89-c78679259a18_fs-idm347219888">Business owners and individuals are willing to pay insurance premiums in the hope that they will never have to be file a claim for reimbursement on their policy. Because the insurance industry profits only when claims are few and small, there may be a bigger role for government to play in managing disaster insurance through a private/public partnership, such as FEMA currently does to provide flood insurance and the California Earthquake Authority does where potentially disastrous earthquakes may occur. Ethical issues such whether to expand the use of public tax revenues to subsidize these partnerships need to be resolved.</p>

<p id="auto_ab7487b1-1b3d-4851-9c54-58e76874a666_fs-idm344250480">The United States, unlike countries in Europe, has little tradition of merging the efforts of the state or federal government with that of private employers in the provision of health care. Although the quality of U.S. health care has rarely been challenged, its limited accessibility has posed ethical quandaries for business because many employees necessarily look to their employers for this benefit. The 2010 Affordable Care Act is an ambitious effort to meet the need for health care for all. Individual states have considered, and sometimes enacted, programs of their own to supply universal health care.</p>

<p id="auto_a8538f97-d8a8-4394-af0f-3afe23577618_fs-idm230191200">Beginning in the eighteenth century, in much of the Western world, the Industrial Revolution transformed the nature of work as industry displaced agriculture as the main driver of the economy and machines took over manual labor. Continuing technological changes have further altered the way people work and even the time and place where they do so. Growing numbers of people now spend some of their time working at home. Are they more productive without the distractions of the office or less productive without constant monitoring by managers? Some major companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft have constructed elaborate workplace campuses, offering unprecedented levels of amenities and even employee housing. Do these campuses facilitate the balancing of work and life, or do they blur the distinction and tie workers to their jobs instead?</p>



<p id="auto_a8538f97-d8a8-4394-af0f-3afe23577618_fs-idm202173712">Job sharing and flexible work schedules have emerged as alternatives to traditional patterns of work. These practices permit some workers to more easily fulfill work and life responsibilities. But does job sharing reflect employers&#8217; efforts to respond to workers&#8217; preferences or is it a move to reduce costs?</p>



<p id="auto_a8538f97-d8a8-4394-af0f-3afe23577618_fs-idm212209984">How will you prepare employees for the impact of robots at work (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_a8538f97-d8a8-4394-af0f-3afe23577618_OSX_Ethics_10_00_RobotHand">Figure 10.1</a>) or manage the outsourcing of tasks to contractors in the gig economy? These challenges to traditional employment settings carry ethical implications for all stakeholders, including employers, employees, suppliers, customers, and clients.</p>

<p id="auto_1ea12f38-fb49-4e77-933b-b229e811c921_fs-idm237547424">What if your business wanted to expand its local operations from six employees to ten but did not have the office space to add more workers? Today&#8217;s businesses have a toolkit of technical solutions to set up working relationships with employees far and wide through voice, computer, video connections, and offsite work-sharing spaces. Coworkers can share files on a remote network server or on the cloud, and managers can use nontraditional methods to monitor activity and performance. Companies like General Assembly, WeWork, and Workbar are leasing access to communal spaces equipped for the business needs of remote workers. Telecommuting is therefore easier to implement than ever. But what exactly are the benefits and drawbacks of telecommuting, and what ethical issues does it raise?</p>

Today, telecommuting means any mode of working at a remote location (home or other space) by virtue of an electronic connection and/or telephone and encompasses a variety of employment types, from gig assignments to part-time contract work to traditional full-time employment.</p>

<p id="auto_1ea12f38-fb49-4e77-933b-b229e811c921_fs-idm194958688">Employees can connect to networked company computers from home and use work-enhancing tools on their laptops, tablets, and smartphones to make real-time connections by voice, text, or video with inexpensive or free applications (or &#8220;apps&#8221;) like FaceTime and Skype. Other software solutions, like GoToMeeting or WebEx, make setting up and even recording a synchronous meeting with sound and video possible for even the smallest companies at fairly low cost. The communication and productivity tools that facilitate telecommuting can only grow in number and sophistication. Virtual reality tools like Microsoft&#8217;s Mixed Reality allow a worker in one location to communicate with the holograph of another person in real time. For example, this technology could enable a job interview with a remote candidate. Of course, the use of technology brings with it the need to ensure information security and protection against hacking, including guaranteeing the authenticity of the persons engaging via this technology.</p>

When some employees telecommute and others do not, those who are in the physical presence of the employer every day can more easily make an impression (good or bad) simply by interacting with their manager. There is also some indication that employees who opt for a nontraditional work arrangement may be penalized if they are perceived as lazy or less dedicated than those who maintain traditional work hours. Employers might have a stronger recollection of the work produced by the employee they see regularly than they do of the work a remote employee is submitting online. Therefore, promotions and important projects may go to employees who are more visible. The remote employee might eventually be left without equal footing in the push for increased pay and status.</p>

To help guard against the risk that telecommuting employees will be unfairly considered &#8220;out of sight, out of mind,&#8221; the ethical company will adopt written expectations about timely communication in both directions. For instance, it should ensure that managers&#8217; lines of communication are as open to their remote employees as they are to those who can drop by their desk or office to chat.</p>

Yet, looking from a different angle, we might consider the motivations behind these complexes to be less than altruistic, because such campuses encourage workers to stay in the office far longer than they might otherwise. Is this the case? Furthermore, if so, do they result in the same or higher levels of productivity? What ethical challenges do they present for the employer and the employee?</p>

Have they created an expectation that the employee who works on a corporate campus where all needed services are provided will, in turn, be accessible for long hours of work on a regular basis? Are the amenities really velvet handcuffs that tie employees to work? Living right next to work clearly will reduce commuting time, and via this path, it may promote work-life balance. But the expectation that long hours should be routine just because they are possible will hamper, rather than facilitate, the quest for work-life balance. Furthermore, to the extent that mega-corporate campuses do tie workers to their jobs, reduced worker mobility means that labor markets will be less able to adjust to changing conditions.</p>

However, the all-encompassing aspect of these workplaces means a manager&#8217;s job description greatly expands to include small-city management functions. As the April 2018 shooting of employees at YouTube&#8217;s headquarters suggests, corporate campuses may have a greater need for security, with duties that dovetail those of the city police. Growth of the compound will challenge managers to comply with city planning and zoning regulations. How should these villages within a city contribute to the municipal services they need for the population they draw? Should the city be able to require a greater tax contribution from mega-corporate campus developers that equals the load they add to the city&#8217;s fiscal responsibilities?</p>

Jobs (who died in 2011) also hoped the building would enable Apple to better safeguard its secrets, because it is large enough to house so many employees and data systems in one secure location. The building is sustainable due to solar panels that provide all its energy needs, and the campus includes nine thousand drought-resistant trees planted to withstand a changing climate. Parking is limited by design to encourage employees to use public transportation and share rides.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_191f467c-07b4-4af5-942d-12b16730b88f_rf-011" id="191f467c-07b4-4af5-942d-12b16730b88f-endNote44"><sup class="os-end-note-number">44</sup></a></c:para>

<p id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_fs-idm227590208">In <span data-type="term" id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_term261" group-by="j">job sharing</span>, two or more employees perform the work of a full-time position, each taking part of the total workload for the job. For example, one job-sharing employee might work three eight-hour shifts a week and the other would take two such shifts at the same job. In some ways, job sharing is simply another name for part-time work. The two people need not work equal numbers of hours, but they perform a single job, doing the same tasks and shouldering the same responsibilities. Unlike nurses, who work shifts but each has their own job, job sharers work one job between them.</p>
<p id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_fs-idm183205920">Most people in the United States seek a full-time job of thirty-five hours a week or more, usually because they want the income and benefits (such as health insurance) that often come with such a job. But some are willing to forego full-time work because they need or want to care for children or an elderly or ailing family member, pursue their education, run a business on the side, or volunteer. Allowing two people to share a job is an option that can lead to enhanced work-life balance for both individuals. A job-sharing parent can work weekends only, for example, saving on daycare costs during the week.</p>

<p id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_fs-idm206015680">The <span data-type="term" id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_term263" group-by="a">access economy</span> is essentially a resource circulation system in which consumers participate on both sides of a transaction, as both providers and obtainers of resources (the transaction is usually facilitated by a third party acting as a go-between). The model, sometimes called peer-to-peer (or P2P), is particularly popular when the asset is expensive to obtain and is not fully consumed by the user (such as a house or condo). In the traditional capitalist economic model, goods are bought and sold by businesses and individuals, but in the access or sharing economy, goods and services are traded on the basis of access rather than ownership.</p>
<p id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_fs-idm207176016">In this business model, owners make money from underused assets. The global online hospitality marketplace is an example. Airbnb says consumer-hosts in San Francisco who rent out their homes do so for an average of about sixty nights a year, making almost $10,000 from such rentals. Car owners using the service RelayRides make an average of $250 a month from allowing others to use their cars. This helps consumers supplement their incomes or even finance the purchase of the assets they share. Many of the original sharing-economy businesses are now household names, including Airbnb, Uber, and Lyft; thousands more are part of the P2P decentralized markets.</p>
<p id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_fs-idm215680672">Most sharing or collaborative economy business models use the Internet to facilitate transactions, so it might be more accurate to refer to them as part of the <em data-effect="italics">online platform economy</em>. However, whereas some facilitate the renting of assets, such as real estate (think Airbnb), others are essentially selling labor (think Task Rabbit), and some bridge the two categories by offering a combination (think Lyft) (see <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_OSX_Ethics_10_03_Platforms">Figure 10.7</a>). The new business models all have something in common, however: a decentralized and democratized marketplace featuring broad-scale participation, with consumers serving multiple roles.</p>

<p id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_fs-idm182970768">Online and digital business models allow almost anyone to start a business from scratch in what some call the democratization of free enterprise. An economy so open to new players is a significant step toward increased buyer access to goods and services at all levels, even as it raises legitimate questions about how to ensure trust between the transacting parties.</p>
<p id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_fs-idm199133168">One issue facing the access economy is regulation. For example, should private individuals who rent out rooms be regulated like a Marriott hotel or perhaps a bed-and-breakfast operator, or simply be considered consumers allowing a guest to stay in their house? They are not only subject to income taxes on the money they earn but they are increasingly likely to be charged hotel or occupancy taxes. Some cities have passed ordinances to limit real estate rentals to minimum stays of a week or a month; shorter stays will be considered hotel rentals subject to regulations such as health and safety code rules. In the ride-sharing segment, some cities have said drivers must undergo the same scrutiny as taxi or limousine drivers, such as fingerprinting, commercial licensing, training, and background checks.</p>
<p id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_fs-idm201945088">The access economy presents an ethical and regulatory challenge for all levels of government&#8212;balancing the need to have at least some rules to protect consumers with the desire to allow competition from new business models. Big businesses are lobbying legislative bodies to apply the same regulation to the access economy as to the traditional economy in an effort to reduce or eliminate the threat of competition. This, in turn, raises an ethical question for society as a whole. Traditional means of raising capital, whether through initial public offerings (IPOs) or venture capital, are often dominated by big players. Should access to capital remain limited to those who have influence, or should the government pursue policies aimed at facilitating access to capital by small businesses? In one sign of increasing acceptance of the access economy, traditional businesses are starting to invest in smaller, more nimble, platforms, as the following feature on Oasis Collections demonstrates.</p>

This financing quandary demonstrates the limited access to capital that often forms a barrier for entrepreneurial startups to overcome. Oasis&#8217; founders turned to sources often used by entrepreneurs, including a mix of seed funding from founders, friends, and family, and angel funding from a private investor. The company operated on a relatively tight budget for several years.</p>

An IPO is essentially a method of funding a startup by selling its stock to the public at large, a process heavily regulated by the government. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees the applicable federal laws, which require the filing of a registration statement and a full disclosure of financial information, along with months of effort by accountants, attorneys, underwriters, and company executives. The cost and complexity of this process usually outweighs the benefit for entrepreneurs who want to raise a modest amount of capital ($10 million or less).</p>

Thus, in 2012, Congress enacted new legislation called the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act, which amended U.S. securities laws to enable small businesses to use a variation on a technique known as crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is already in use as a way to give or lend money to consumers and businesses through web portals such as GoFundMe. But those sites do not offer SEC-compliant sales of securities in a business, as the JOBS Act now permits emerging growth companies (EGCs) seeking capital to do. This new type of funding should help level the playing field for EGCs; many view it as a way of democratizing access to capital.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_rf-018" id="10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de-endNote64"><sup class="os-end-note-number">64</sup></a> One entrepreneurial startup that used this new method successfully is Betabrand, a San Francisco&#8211;based retail clothing company that doubles as a crowdfunding platform.

A freelancer or contractor is a self-employed worker who may work with more than one client but who usually has a contract that covers the details of the job, including compensation. The terms freelancer and contractor are generally used interchangeably. However, if there is a distinction, it is that a freelancer is almost always self-employed and works for multiple companies, whereas a contractor may or may not be self-employed and may work for only one company at a time (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_OSX_Ethics_10_03_Employment">Figure 10.8</a>). Some may be happily committed to their independent status; others are involuntarily self-employed while they search for more permanent or full-time positions. Gigs might be full- or part-time; they might be limited to a specific task or a specific time; and they may serve as the worker&#8217;s sole employment or as a &#8220;moonlighting&#8221; job.

It hired some of the workers as well, but others sued for fringe benefits they had been denied as freelancers. After lengthy litigation and appeals, in 2000, Microsoft agreed to pay thousands of plaintiffs a total of $97 million, the value of stock options they would have received if it had employed them. It was the largest settlement ever received by a group of temporary employees. Today, Microsoft has more 110,000 employees, and about 75 percent are temporary or contract workers.

Although state labor laws governing internships vary, responsible companies will insist that their interns are paid for their services or receive academic credit, or both.</p>

In this module, we will look at how future workforce demographics may be affected by existing and emerging technologies. The combination of automation and robotics has already changed not only the workplace but everyday life as well. It also comes with a host of ethical and legal issues, not least being where humans will fit in the workplace of tomorrow. Managers of the future may ask, &#8220;Does my company or society benefit from having a human do a job rather than a robot, or is it all about efficiency and cost?&#8221;</p>

<p id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_fs-idm363021312">Advances in the field of <span data-type="term" id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_term266" group-by="r">robotics</span>&#8212;a combination of computer science, mechanical and electronics engineering, and science&#8212;have meant that machines or related forms of automation now do the work of humans in a wide variety of settings, such as medicine, where robots perform surgeries previously done by the surgeon&#8217;s hand. Robots have made it easier and cheaper for employers to get work done. The downside, however, is that some reasonably well-paying jobs that provided middle-class employment for humans have become the province of machines.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_90381">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm363653376">A McKinsey Global Institute study of eight hundred occupations in nearly fifty countries showed that more than 800 million jobs, or 20 percent of the global workforce, could be lost to robotics by the year 2030.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_rf-001" id="9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96-endNote74"><sup class="os-end-note-number">74</sup></a> The effects could be even more pronounced in wealthy industrialized nations, such as the United States and Germany, where researchers expect that up to one-third of the workforce will be affected. By 2030, the report estimates that 39 million to 73 million jobs may be eliminated in the United States. Given that the level of employment in the United States in mid-2018 is approaching 150 million workers, this potential loss of jobs represents roughly one-quarter to one-half of total current employment (but a smaller share of employment in 2030 because of future population and employment growth).</c:para>
<p id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_fs-idm360630656">The big question, then, is what will happen to all these displaced workers. The McKinsey report estimates that about twenty million of them will be able to transfer easily to other industries for employment. But this still leaves between twenty million and more than fifty million displaced workers who will need new employment. Occupational retraining is likely to be a path taken by some, but older workers, as well as geographically immobile workers, are unlikely to opt for such training and may endure job loss for protracted periods.</p>
<p id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_fs-idm331846928">In developing countries, the report predicts that the number of jobs requiring less education will shrink. Furthermore, robotics will have less impact in poorer countries because these nations&#8217; workers are already paid so little that employers will save less on labor costs by automating. According to the report, for example, by the same date of 2030, India is expected to lose only about 9 percent of its jobs to emerging technology.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_28540">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm337276512">Which occupations will be most heavily affected? Not surprisingly, the McKinsey report concludes that machine operators, factory workers, and food workers will be hit hardest, because robots can do their jobs more precisely and efficiently. &#8220;It&#8217;s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who&#8217;s inefficiently making $15 an hour bagging French fries,&#8221; said a former McDonald&#8217;s CEO in another article about the consequences of robots in the labor market.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_rf-002" id="9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96-endNote75"><sup class="os-end-note-number">75</sup></a> He estimated that <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_term267" group-by="a">automation</span> has already cut the number of people working in a McDonald&#8217;s by half since the 1960s and that this trend will continue. Other hard-hit jobs will include mortgage brokers, paralegals, accountants, some office staff, cashiers, toll booth operators, and car and truck drivers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that eighty thousand fast-food jobs will disappear by 2024. As growing numbers of retail stores like Walmart, CVS, and McDonald&#8217;s provide automated self-checkout options, it has been estimated that 7.5 million retail jobs are at risk over the course of the next decade. Furthermore, it has been estimated that as self-driving cars and trucks replace automobile and truck drivers, five million jobs will be lost in the early 2020s.</c:para>
<p id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_fs-idm361341120">Jobs requiring human interaction are typically at low risk for being replaced by automation. These include nurses and most physicians, lawyers, teachers, and bartenders, as well as social workers (estimated by the BLS to grow by 19 percent by 2024), hairstylists and cosmetologists, youth sports coaches, and songwriters. McKinsey also anticipates that specialized lower-wage jobs like gardening, plumbing, and care work will be less affected by automation.</p>
<p id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_fs-idm373509664">The challenge to the economy, then, will be how to address the prospect of substantial job loss; about twenty million to fifty million people will not be able to easily find new jobs. The McKinsey report notes that new technology, as in the past, will generate new types of jobs. But this is unlikely to help more than a small fraction of those confronting unemployment. So the United States will likely face some combination of rapidly rising unemployment, an urgent need to retrain twenty million or more workers, and recourse to policies whereby the government serves as an employer of last resort.</p>

At first, Japan&#8217;s robots were found mainly in factories making automobiles and electronic equipment, performing simple jobs such as assembling parts. Now Japan is poised to take the lead by putting robots in diverse areas including aeronautics, medicine, disaster mitigation, and search and rescue, performing jobs that human either cannot or, for safety reasons (such as defusing a bomb), should not do. Leading universities such as the University of Tokyo offer advanced programs to teach students not only how to create robots but also how to understand the way robot technology is transforming Japanese society. Universities, research institutions, corporations, and government entities are collaborating to implement the country&#8217;s next generation of advanced artificial intelligence robot technology, because Japan truly sees the rise of robotics as the &#8220;Fourth Industrial Revolution.&#8221;</p>
<p id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_fs-idm360648784">New uses of robots include hazardous cleanup in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster that destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. After those events, Japan accelerated its development and application of disaster-response robots to go into radioactive areas and handle remediation.</p>
<p id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_fs-idm358585056">In the laboratory at the University of Tokyo School of Engineering, advances are also being made in technology that mimics the capabilities of the human eye. One application allows scientists a clear field of vision in extreme weather conditions that are otherwise difficult or impossible for humans to study.</p>
<p id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_fs-idm375688944">Japanese researchers are also developing a surgical robotic system with a three-dimensional endoscope to conduct high-risk surgery in remote mountainous regions with no specialized doctors. This system is in use in operating rooms in the United States as well, but Japan is taking it a step further by using it in <em data-effect="italics">teletherapy,</em> where the patient is hundreds of miles away from the doctor actually performing the surgery. In Japan&#8217;s manufacturing culture, robots are viewed not as threats but as solutions to many of the nation&#8217;s most critical problems. Indeed, with Japan&#8217;s below-replacement fertility since the mid-1970s, Japan&#8217;s work force has been aging quite rapidly; in fact, beginning in the period from 2010 to 2015, the Japanese population started shrinking. Clearly, robots are potentially quite important as a means to offset prospective adverse consequences of a diminishing labor force.</p>

<p id="auto_9bd6a71f-e5bb-449f-9a24-11a20d38fe96_fs-idm375920736">For example, as AI programs become better able to interact with humans, especially online, should a company be required to inform its customers if and when they are dealing with any form of AI and not a person? If people cannot tell when they are communicating with an AI program and not a human being, has an AI-controlled computer or robot reached a form personhood? Why or why not? Although traditional business ethics can provide us with a starting place to answer such questions, we will also need a philosophical approach, because we also need to decide whether it is necessary to have consciousness to be considered a person. This issue is further muddied when a human employee largely is tapping AI i to serve customers or clients. Should this combination of human and AI assistance be made patently clear?</p>

<p id="auto_1ea12f38-fb49-4e77-933b-b229e811c921_fs-idm230482608">Remote workers save themselves the time and cost of a commute and are better able to balance work and home life. Companies often benefit from the higher productivity and lower turnover of telecommuting employees, and they can also provide a social benefit by permitting employees to avoid commuting, reducing traffic congestion and pollution. Some challenges of telecommuting for the manager are maintaining the privacy of the firm&#8217;s data, transmitting corporate culture, defining performance objectives, and encouraging collaboration. Employees have the challenge of remaining focused on work when they are working elsewhere. Ethical companies support their remote workers by developing and encouraging trust and guarding against abuse. They also set clear and equitable expectations and rewards to ensure fairness and keep open the lines of communication.</p>

<p id="auto_191f467c-07b4-4af5-942d-12b16730b88f_fs-idm229075184">Traditional office buildings with separate workspaces for each worker are giving way to multifunctional worksites where employees are encouraged to actively collaborate. Some companies have expanded the workplace to include restaurants, recreation facilities, and convenient amenities to attract and retain employees. Other companies are building villages around their campuses to assist employees seeking to balance work and home life. These all-encompassing work environments have some potential downsides for employees, however, including a risk of tethering them to their workplaces. Their effects on local communities are being questioned as well.</p>

<p id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_fs-idm224438480">When undertaken with equity and fairness, job sharing and flextime can create flexibility for workers who need or want to limit their hours. These practices allow employers to recruit more diverse employees, help them meet employees&#8217; need for work-life balance, and, in the case of job sharing, bring more than one person&#8217;s perspective to problem solving. However, employers must clearly spell out expectations and procedures for each employee to ensure success.</p>
<p id="auto_10b16490-d1b2-48c3-8faa-be4b70e299de_fs-idm231633616">Given flexible hours and job-sharing arrangements, the traditional employment-based U.S. economy appears to be in transition toward new business models that offer many opportunities but also serious challenges. Ethical issues in the access economy include the responsibilities of each of the parties in a sharing transaction and the character of any regulation, including taxes, that may be passed. In the gig economy, they include workers&#8217; insecure positions and lack of benefits, employers&#8217; responsibility for paying their fair share of social insurance (payroll) taxes, and the fair treatment of interns.</p>

Fear of losing jobs is a reality, but so too is intrigue about what the future holds. A key for companies is to help workers retrain to become part of that future.</p>

<p id="auto_677e64a2-8e77-4e57-9145-7d2e265991a8_fs-idm231541056">Even though they are business decisions, the choices we make at work can be personal in that they begin with our use of conscience. Just as the human body requires nourishment and care, so the conscience needs attention. Developmental psychologists have long understood that the formation of conscience, and the emergence of an individual in whom being and doing are comfortably aligned, take place over time. There are no shortcuts. Imperfection, self-doubt, and mistakes are part of the process. But what counts in life&#8212;including our choice of profession as well as the way we live our personal lives&#8212;is the manner in which we apply wisdom, education, and experience in forming the decisions we make and in becoming the person we wish to be.</p>



<p id="auto_677e64a2-8e77-4e57-9145-7d2e265991a8_fs-idm226981584">Facing the right direction may be difficult at first, but with each decision toward wholeness, the path becomes a little easier to tread. The reverse is also true. When we neglect or ignore our conscience, it becomes more difficult for us to turn around. This final chapter explores the process of becoming a professional with an unshakeable ethical stance in a changing world. Where do you stand on your own path in life, and more important, which direction are you facing (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_677e64a2-8e77-4e57-9145-7d2e265991a8_OSX_Ethics_11_00_RoadAhead">Figure 11.1</a>)? In which direction will your choices regarding your work and career take you?</p>

A respected business leader and cofounder of the Indian School of Business and the American Indian Foundation, Gupta served on many corporate and philanthropic boards. &#8220;Gupta was commended by people who knew him as a person who helped others.

Gupta was convicted of felony securities fraud relating to insider trading (three counts) and conspiracy (one count) and sentenced to two years in jail plus $5 million in fines.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_4402cf86-a598-461c-8fc2-99946c2203d7_rf-002" id="4402cf86-a598-461c-8fc2-99946c2203d7-endNote2"><sup class="os-end-note-number">2</sup></a> He had chosen to violate both business ethics and the law, as well as breaching his fiduciary duty as a corporate director.</c:para>

That is not a bad thing. We should value ethical behavior for its own sake, not because it will draw media attention. Unethical behavior, on the other hand, is often considered newsworthy, as were the crimes of Rajat Gupta. In discussing his case, the Seven Pillars Institute for Global Finance and Ethics (an independent, nonprofit think tank based in Kansas City, Missouri, that helps raise public awareness about financial ethics) said, &#8220;As a true professional, the good manager strives to achieve a moral excellence that includes honesty, fairness, prudence, and courage.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_4402cf86-a598-461c-8fc2-99946c2203d7_rf-003" id="4402cf86-a598-461c-8fc2-99946c2203d7-endNote3"><sup class="os-end-note-number">3</sup></a> These are some of the virtues ethical players in the corporate world display.</c:para>

The primary purpose of business ethics is to guide organizations and their employees in this effort by outlining a mode of behavior that proactively identifies and implements the right actions to take, ones that avoid lapses in judgment and deed. For instance, as we saw in <a href="#cfbb0e1b-9aa6-435b-ab0b-9133a48a0c93">Defining and Prioritizing Stakeholders</a>, identifying the needs and rights of all stakeholders, not just of shareholders, is a useful first step in fair and ethical decision-making for any business organization.

Over the years, it has jettisoned some of its once-popular brands, including Oldsmobile and Pontiac, sold many others, and climbed back from a 2009 bankruptcy and reorganization. The automaker was hiding an even bigger problem, however: The ignition switch in many of its cars was prone to malfunction, causing injury and even death. The faulty switches caused 124 deaths and 273 injuries, and GM was finally brought to federal court. In 2014, the company reached a settlement for $900 million and recalled 2.6 million cars.</p>

<p id="auto_4402cf86-a598-461c-8fc2-99946c2203d7_fs-idm227899408">At first glance, you might not see many parallels between the purchase of a flask of wine in an ancient Greek marketplace and your online purchase of a week&#8217;s worth of groceries with a single click. In both cases, however, and throughout all the generations in between, buyers and sellers would agree that customers are entitled to be treated with honesty and accorded fair value for their money. Business leaders should approach ethical issues with the same sense of the permanence of ethical values. Technological innovation has changed the business environment and our lives, but it does not change the basis on which we make ethical business decisions. It does however, cause us to <em data-effect="italics">expand</em> the application of our ethical standards to new situations.</p>

Crimes such as identity theft, almost unheard of twenty years ago, remain a huge threat to anyone doing business online&#8212;a majority of the population.

The rise in popularity of data mining and target marketing have forced businesses to walk a fine line between respecting customers&#8217; privacy and using their online activities to glean valuable marketing data.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_4402cf86-a598-461c-8fc2-99946c2203d7_rf-005" id="4402cf86-a598-461c-8fc2-99946c2203d7-endNote5"><sup class="os-end-note-number">5</sup></a></q></c:para>

The restaurant&#8217;s menu is the same in all of its two hundred stores around the world.

That is, does the Cheesecake Factory have an obligation to give customers what they <em data-effect="italics">need</em>, rather than what they <em data-effect="italics">want</em>? In many parts of the world, there is pronounced desire for many things American, in particular, and Western, in general. Do Western companies have a primary mandate simply to meet this want, or do they have an obligation to deliver what is better for others? This is a core ethical consideration that has implications for companies far beyond simple marketing strategies and tactics. To impose certain products and services on other cultures because Western nations believe these would be best for them certainly would be a form of imperialism. However, for corporations to satisfy expressed wants could be applauded as an honorable response to customers identifying their own preferences. To preemptively decide what ought to be consumed by others&#8212;because it is for their own good&#8212;might be a form of paternalism. Ultimately, do customers or do companies have the right to make these decisions?</p>



<p id="auto_4402cf86-a598-461c-8fc2-99946c2203d7_fs-idm232706912">You might answer that it would depend on the company and its products or services, and you would be right to see it in this light. What is unmistakable, however, is that these truly are decisions fraught with ethical dimensions. Business leaders must become accustomed to considering them in this way.</p>

If a corporation with 2.3 million employees globally has reason to be concerned that at least some are dissatisfied with the job and may have witnessed some degree of unethical management behavior, the firm might also need to assume that some of those employees could choose to act unethically in the course of any business day. Of course, no job is perfect, and most of us experience some Monday mornings when we do not necessarily want to go into the office or exert the energy to be productive. And a company that provides high-quality goods to consumers at relatively low prices should get at least some credit for treating consumers fairly and ethically. It remains true, however, that any firm that wishes its employees to act ethically in the workplace must develop managers who model such behavior consistently toward all the company&#8217;s stakeholders. No other single act on the part of business leaders is as important as this in fostering ethical behavior on the part of employees.</p>

<p id="auto_82fffc89-3cf3-4413-984e-ac815d653343_fs-idm232998400">To make the difficult decisions that come with career, personal life, and the balance between both, we must identify our personal values. Values provide us with the <em data-effect="italics">why</em> for doing what we do. As an entrepreneur, for instance, you may find yourself working nonstop, dealing with emergency phone calls at 3:00 a.m., and doing a great deal of soul-searching about the direction and culture of your new venture. These tasks collectively might serve as impediments to happiness unless they truly reflect your underlying values.</p>

<p id="auto_82fffc89-3cf3-4413-984e-ac815d653343_fs-idm233268800">Customers often remain loyal to a brand because of its appearance, functionality, or price. Companies want loyal customers like these and will go to great lengths to keep them. These relationships are external relationships between the company as an organization and its customers as a group.</p>
<p id="auto_82fffc89-3cf3-4413-984e-ac815d653343_fs-idm230080768">Internal relationships exist among people, including among managers, employees, suppliers, and distributors. The loyalty that forms good internal relationships and enables us to rely on one another to do our work is a matter of trust and develops over time. Although it may be tested by rivalry, resentment, misunderstanding, and personality or other conflicts, without such trust, a company cannot function properly.</p>
<p id="auto_82fffc89-3cf3-4413-984e-ac815d653343_fs-idm227759472">However, as we have seen, loyalty between employee and employer is a two-way street. The organization takes the first step by hiring a candidate in whom it will invest time, training, and money, and whose success it will reward with recognition, raises, and bonuses. No employer wants to spend time and money nurturing new talent only to see people leave for another firm. Therefore, it falls to the new professional, in turn, to decide whether his or her values align with those of the organization, and if so, to demonstrate a commitment to grow with the company over time. Achieving such clarity about your career goals, the type of company you would be proud to work for, and your vision of your future self requires some self-scrutiny. In the process, you will further clarify your personal and ethical values and start to become an ethical professional.</p>

<p id="auto_d016890e-f93c-4cbf-b490-cac8a96604d2_fs-idm231011040">The exercise of moral agency includes making a judgment about the alignment of personal and corporate conscience. Rather than jumping at the first job offer, moral agents assess whether the values expressed by the organization conform with their own, while recognizing that there is no perfect job. Even the most ethical organizations make mistakes, and even the most corrupt have managers and workers of integrity (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_d016890e-f93c-4cbf-b490-cac8a96604d2_OSX_Ethics_11_03_Power">Figure 11.6</a>).

<p id="auto_d016890e-f93c-4cbf-b490-cac8a96604d2_fs-idm230840048">You may follow a professional vocation that offers low pay or low status but yields nontangible rewards, such as nonprofit work, nursing, or teaching. Or you may find a position that pays a great deal and offers job security but leaves you feeling unhappy or unfulfilled. For some professionals, these might include law, accounting, dentistry, or anything else. The point is that occupations with high compensation and a certain stature do not always infuse their holders with the greatest psychological and emotional rewards, and it is different for each of us. In the best of all worlds, you might embark on a well-paying career that helps others or contributes a much-needed good or service to society. Finding such work is easier said than done, of course, because the aim of most jobs is not to help people find meaning or happiness. Where these do occur, they are often ancillary effects of work, whose real purpose is the profitability without which there would not be any jobs at all.</p>
<p id="auto_d016890e-f93c-4cbf-b490-cac8a96604d2_fs-idm228228576">Also consider the gap between the purpose of the business and the purpose of the individuals in it. Except in a few startups, these purposes are not identical. Even artists, musicians, and independent practitioners who derive great meaning from their work are not immune to the frustrations over money or career that affect everyone else.</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_d016890e-f93c-4cbf-b490-cac8a96604d2_82351">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm228927088">It has been estimated, however, that the amount of money needed to be happy is not actually that much, at least by Western standards, although it is well above the poverty line.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_d016890e-f93c-4cbf-b490-cac8a96604d2_rf-006" id="d016890e-f93c-4cbf-b490-cac8a96604d2-endNote25"><sup class="os-end-note-number">25</sup></a> Most people find themselves somewhere in the middle in terms of satisfaction and pay. Finding the proper balance between the two for <em data-effect="italics">you</em> is taking a step on the way to your growth as a professional. You will make that assessment not once but throughout your career as you move in and out of jobs. Even if it turns out to be the best decision of your life, the choice to work for a company because of its mission, leadership, or cultural values should be intentional and based on sufficient knowledge of the company and yourself. To be appreciated for your contributions in the workplace, to work with congenial colleagues, or to provide a product or service of which you are proud might rival money as your most intrinsic motivator at work. Studies attest to this and, as professionals of integrity, we must each decide for ourselves how strong a benefit salary alone is in the jobs we select.</c:para>

This modeling sets what is known as &#8220;tone at the top.&#8221; Employees may already have a personal moral code when they join an organization, but when they see key figures in the workplace actually living out the ethical values of the company, they are more likely to follow suit and take ethics seriously. Leaders&#8217; ethical behavior is especially important in emerging fields like artificial intelligence, where questions of safety, bias, misuse of technology, and privacy are raised daily.<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_d016890e-f93c-4cbf-b490-cac8a96604d2_rf-007" id="d016890e-f93c-4cbf-b490-cac8a96604d2-endNote26"><sup class="os-end-note-number">26</sup></a> It is not enough to offer codes of conduct, training, reporting, and review programs, no matter how thorough or sophisticated, if management does not adhere to or promote them. These are tools rather than solutions. The solutions come from leaders using the tools and showing others how to do the same. This takes practice, reinforcement, and collaboration at all levels of an organization. The result will be a culture of ethics that permeates the company from top to bottom.</c:para>

Moreover, the benefit of ethical behavior can grow over time so that a company begins to attract other ethical professionals and develops a reputation for honesty, integrity, and dependability. In a globally competitive world, these are not inconsequential factors. In an ethical workplace, employee satisfaction creates more loyalty to the company and morale improves because employees and managers feel they are part of an effort they can be proud of. Business performance picks up in ways ranging from higher earnings per share to increased customer retention to more satisfied employees.</p>

<p id="auto_d016890e-f93c-4cbf-b490-cac8a96604d2_fs-idm229319472">Again, employee loyalty, a positive work environment, and strong financial performance are not accidents; they are the result of intentional efforts on the part of leadership and board members who provide ethical vision and a plan for execution to all stakeholders. Ethical business need not be a zero-sum game with winners and losers; it can create situations in which everyone wins. Is there a more attractive environment for those just starting out in their careers? To be part of something profitable, responsible, and individually uplifting justifies all the work required to get there.</p>

Do you believe an employer&#8217;s enlightened self-interest is enough to ensure the ethical behavior of employers and employees? Or do you embrace &#8220;the critical importance of individual ethical choice in making our organizations, our professions and our culture serve all of humanity&#8221;?<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_rf-001" id="7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3-endNote34"><sup class="os-end-note-number">34</sup></a></c:para>



<p id="auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_fs-idm231320528">As attractive as high salary and comfortable lifestyle are to many, the life of a true professional is guided less by the desire to amass material goods than by a willingness to adhere to a code of ethical behavior and make the sometimes selfless decisions that protect the public and the corporation from misdeeds. In ideal form, that code of behavior is an expression of everything we have covered in this text regarding virtue, character, commitment, resilience, and the use of professional skills and training for the benefit of others. As first-century BCE Jewish religious leader Rabbi Hillel is said to have put it, &#8220;If I am not for myself, then who will be? And if I am only for myself, then what am I? And if not now, when?&#8221;</p>



<p id="auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_fs-idm230714880">Today, it is often said that what counts at the end of a career is not how much money we made or how high up the corporate ladder we climbed. Rather, the real test is the difference we made&#8212;whether we have helped others or succumbed to motives such as greed and hubris (excess pride). Hubris creates the delusion that we are above the law and will never get caught. It has been used to justify many ruthless decisions whose sole criterion, in the end, is the potential for personal gain. This book has provided many examples on which to reflect about whether taking this short-term view actually benefits the company. In fact, hubris has ruined many lives and taken down a number of companies. Some, like Enron and Theranos, were once touted as icons of efficiency and ethical leadership.</p>

<p id="auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_fs-idm231281824">The values we choose to honor are the essence of ourselves, and we carry them with us wherever we live, work, and play. As we noted, the career you choose should reflect your values, whether you work at a for-profit or nonprofit organization, at Wells Fargo Bank or Doctors Without Borders (a medical rescue organization). It also is possible that you might work for a for-profit company and volunteer extensively on your own or on behalf of your firm in the nonprofit sector. Whatever path your career takes, it remains important not to let your well-considered values be diminished by others who do not prize loyalty or industriousness, for instance. Your career is not a contest in which the person who finishes with the biggest portfolio or fastest jet skis wins anything other than an empty prize. It is far better to treat others with integrity and respect and be surrounded by the true emblems of a successful career&#8212;family, friends, and colleagues who will attest to the dignity with which you have worked. In the final analysis, if you achieve a life of honor, then you have won.</p>
<p id="auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_fs-idm210568080">How do you keep personal values like integrity, fairness, and respect close at hand? The best way is by writing them down, prioritizing them, and fashioning them into a personal mission statement. Most companies have mission statements, and people can have them, too. Yours will guide you on your path, clear away distractions on the road, and help you correct any missteps. It should be flexible, too, to account for changes in yourself and your goals. Your mission statement is not a global positioning system so much as a compass that guides you toward discovering who you are and what drives you (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_OSX_Ethics_11_04_YourPath">Figure 11.7</a>).</p>

Startups cannot be run on concepts alone. More than almost any other kind of venture, they demand practical solutions and efficient methods. Entrepreneurs usually begin by identifying a product or service that is hard to come by in a particular market or that might be abundantly available but is overpriced or unreliable. The overall guiding force that inspires the startup then is the execution of the company&#8217;s mission, which dictates much of the primary direction for the firm, including the identification of underserved customers, the geographic site for a headquarters, and the partners, suppliers, employees, and financing that help the company get off the ground and then expand. In a brand-new organization, though, where does that mission come from?</p>
<p id="auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_fs-idm233318128">The founder or founders of a firm develop the company&#8217;s mission directly from their own personal beliefs, values, and experience; this is particularly true for nonprofits. Sometimes the inspiration is as simple as the recognition of an unmet need, such as the rising global demand for food. Bertha Jimenez, an immigrant from Ecuador who was studying engineering at New York University, could not help but be concerned that while craft breweries were riding a wave of popularity in her adopted city, they were also throwing away a lot of barley grain that still had nutritional value but that no one could figure out how to reuse. After a few attempts, Jimenez and two friends, also immigrants, finally hit on the idea of making flour out of this barley grain, and thus was born the Queens, New York&#8211;based startup Rise Products, whose website proclaims that &#8220;Upcycling is the future of food.&#8221;</p>
<div class="not-converted-yet" id="auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_40957">NOT_CONVERTED_YET: para</div><c:para id="fs-idm232943456">Rise Products does not only supplies local bakers and pasta makers with its protein- and fiber-packed &#8220;super&#8221; barley flour for use in products from pizza dough to brownies. It has also sent product samples on request to Kellogg, Whole Foods, and Nestl&#233;, as well as to a top chef in Italy. Jimenez and her fellow cofounders say, &#8220;In the long term, we can bring this to countries like ours. We want to look at technologies that won&#8217;t be prohibitive for other people to have.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_rf-004" id="7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3-endNote37"><sup class="os-end-note-number">37</sup></a></c:para>

TOMS Shoes is another entrepreneurial firm founded to fill a need: For every pair sold, the company donates a pair of shoes to a child without any. Over time, TOMS Shoes has expanded its mission to also offer eyeglasses and improved access to clean water to people in developing countries. It calls itself the &#8220;One for One&#8221; company, promoting founder Blake Mycoskie&#8217;s promise that &#8220;With every product you purchase, TOMS will help a person in need.&#8221;<a data-type="cite" href="#auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_rf-005" id="7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3-endNote38"><sup class="os-end-note-number">38</sup></a></c:para>
<p id="auto_7b73fb75-1a2e-4e8b-be32-dfcd6d3dd5d3_fs-idm230865152">The point is, if you have clarified your personal values and mission statement, there is almost no limit to the number of ways you can apply them to your business goals and decisions to &#8220;do good and do well&#8221; in your career. The purpose of business is relationships, and the quality of relationships depends on our acceptance of self and concern for others. These are developed through the virtues of humility on the one hand and courage on the other. The demanding but essential task of life is to practice both. In that way&#8212;perhaps <em data-effect="italics">only</em> in that way&#8212;can we be truly human and successful business professionals.</p>

<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192246480"><span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_term273" group-by="A">Aristotle</span> (384 BCE&#8211;322 BCE) was a student of Plato, who was himself a student of Socrates, one of the founders of Western philosophy. Aristotle spent about twenty years at Plato&#8217;s Academy in Athens, first as a student and then as an associate. Later he tutored the young Alexander of Macedonia, who would become Alexander the Great.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_footnote-ref1"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_footnote1">1</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm164779248">Aristotle eventually returned to Athens where he opened his own school, the Lyceum, and where he studied and taught extensively in philosophy, government, and the natural and social sciences. He, along with most of the classical Greek thinkers, believed that all academic disciplines were linked. They were far less inclined than we are to rigidly separate academic subjects.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192341392">Aristotle&#8217;s principle work on ethics, <em data-effect="italics">The Nicomachean Ethics</em>, was dedicated either to his father or son, both of whom were named Nicomachus, a popular name within his family. In <em data-effect="italics">Ethics</em>, where Aristotle laid out the essence of virtue theory, he stated that if we truly desire people to be ethical, then we must have them practice ethics from an early age. Just as Plato claimed that unethical individuals are simply uneducated in ethics, so Aristotle held that constant practice is the best means by which to create ethical humans. He contended that men&#8212;for Aristotle, unlike Plato, education was restricted to males&#8212;who are taught to be ethical in minor matters as boys will automatically act ethically in all matters as they mature. Of course, a legitimate question regarding both philosophers is whether we believe they are correct on these points.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm193237280">In <em data-effect="italics">Ethics</em>, Aristotle introduced the concept of what is usually referred to as the golden mean of moderation. He believed that every virtue resides somewhere between the vices of defect and excess. That is, one can display either too little or too much of a good thing, or a virtue. The trick, as for Goldilocks, is to have just the right amount of it. Adding to the complexity of this, however, is the fact that striking the right balance between too much and too little does not necessarily put one midway between the two. The mean of moderation is more of a sliding value, fluctuating between defect and excess, but not automatically splitting the difference between them. Depending on the virtue in question, the mean may lie closer to a deficit or to a surplus. For example, take the virtue of courage (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_OSX_Ethics_01_AA_Courage">Figure A2</a>). For Aristotle, the mean laid closer to foolhardiness or brashness. It&#8217;s not that foolhardiness is less a vice than cowardice; it&#8217;s just that courage verges closer to the one than to the other.</p>

<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm195697008">What constitutes a virtue in the first place, according to Aristotle? Besides courage, the virtues include wisdom, kindness, love, beauty, honesty, and justice. These approximate the same virtues proclaimed by Plato.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192932864">Aristotle also speaks of <em data-effect="italics">eudaemonia</em>, a perfect balance of happiness and goodness interpreted classically. Humans experience <em data-effect="italics">eudaemonia</em> both in themselves and in the world when they act virtuously and live a life of rational thought and contemplation. As Aristotle argued, rational thought is the activity of the divine, so it is appropriate for men to emulate this practice, as well.</p>

<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm167644320">Jeremy <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_term274" group-by="B">Bentham</span>, an attorney, became what we would today call a consultant to the British Parliament in the late-eighteenth century. He was given the task of devising a method by which members could evaluate the worth of proposed legislation. He took a Latin term&#8212;<em data-effect="italics">util</em>, or utility, usefulness, or happiness&#8212;and calculated the number of utils in proposed bills. Essentially this quantified the scoring of upcoming legislation&#8212;those pieces with the greatest number of utils were given a higher ranking than those with the least.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm166389424">Utilitarianism as an ethical system today, though it has application to many areas beyond that simply of lawmaking, holds to this same principle. When making moral decisions, we are advised to select that action which produces the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people. If the balance of good or happiness or usefulness outweighs that of evil, harm, or unhappiness, then the choice is a moral one. On the other hand, if the balance of evil outweighs that of good, then the choice is immoral. Due to this emphasis on the outcome of ethical decisions, utilitarianism is classified as a consequentialist theory.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm183076400">Bentham lays much of his theory out in <em data-effect="italics">An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation</em> (1789). There, he proposes the hedonic calculus&#8212;from the Greek <em data-effect="italics">hedone</em>, or pleasure&#8212;as a mechanism by which one can determine the amount of pleasure versus pain in moral choices.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm164481360">Bentham found a ready supporter and lieutenant in James Mill (1773&#8211;1836), a Scottish lawyer who came to assist Bentham in championing utilitarianism as a political philosophy. And when Mill&#8217;s son, John Stuart, was born, Bentham, having no children of his own, became his godfather. Together, Bentham and the elder Mill established a curriculum through which the younger Mill was schooled at home, an arrangement that was not uncommon in the early nineteenth century. John Stuart was evidently a prodigy and at an early age was taking on Greek, Latin, economic theory, and higher mathematics.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192245456">An odd twist accompanies the arrangements that Bentham made for his body after his death. Because donated cadavers were rare in teaching hospitals and this had led to a rash of grave-robbing, he stipulated that his body be dissected by surgeons for the education of their students, while in the presence of his friends. He further requested that, afterward, his body be re-stitched together, dressed in his own clothes, and perpetually displayed at what was then a new school that he had endowed, University College in London. To this day, Bentham&#8217;s corpse, with a wax head to replace the original, mummified one, is posed in a glass case at meetings of the trustees of University College, all by provision of his will.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm187981152">John Stuart <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_term275" group-by="M">Mill</span>, as he reached adulthood, became a leader of the second generation of utilitarians. He broke with his mentor, though, in one significant way: by distinguishing between different levels of pleasure&#8212;higher and lower ones&#8212;and offering a means by which to determine where any given pleasure falls. While Bentham insisted that ranking pleasures were subjective and that no one could truly say that some pleasures were objectively more worthy than others, the younger Mill claimed that we could indeed specifically determine which pleasures were the higher ones by polling educated people. Those pleasures which were ranked highest by this select cohort were indeed the greatest ones, and those which were ranked least were the inferior ones.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm171922304">Mill also refined the political applications of utilitarianism and, in so doing, laid the foundation for the political movement of libertarianism. Though he himself never used this term and probably would take issue with being labeled a libertarian were he alive today, he did introduce many of the principles that are esteemed by libertarians. In his most important work on political freedoms, <em data-effect="italics">On Liberty</em> (1859), he introduced the no-harm rule. By this, Mill proposed that no individual be deprived of his or her right to act in any fashion, even a self-destructive one, provided that his or her action does not impinge <em data-effect="italics">physically</em> on others.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_footnote-ref2"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_footnote2">2</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm162852240">For example, according to Mill, we may try to persuade an alcoholic to give up drinking. We may marshal our best arguments in an attempt to convince him or her that this is wrong and harmful&#8212;&#8220;remonstrate&#8221; is the verb that he employed. Still, if the alcoholic persists in drinking excessively despite our best efforts to encourage him or her otherwise, then no power of the state ought to be brought to bear to prevent him or her from drinking, unless and until the drinking causes physical harm to others. One can see the application of this to, say, motorcycle-helmet laws today. Mill would hold that even though the injury-preventing capacity of helmets clearly can be demonstrated, bikers still ought to be permitted to refrain from wearing them if they so choose.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm200459312">The significance of utilitarianism in our era lies in the fact that many of us implement utilitarian thought processes when we have to make many ethical choices, even if we don&#8217;t necessarily consider ourselves to be utilitarians. In addition, utilitarianism continues to influence new generations of philosophers and ethical thinkers, such as the Australian Peter Singer, an inspiration for the contemporary animal rights movement who is currently on the faculty at Princeton University.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm191130352">A telling critique of utilitarianism, however, is the objection that it assays no good or evil in acts themselves, but only in the good or evil that these acts produce. If a proposed municipal, state, or federal law could be demonstrated to serve the defined interests of a majority at the expense of the interests only of a minority, then utilitarianism would suggest that such a law is good and moral. Little recognition appears within utilitarianism of the possibility of tyranny of the majority. Many critics of utilitarianism have scored this weakness of the ethical system. A persuasive instance of this is the short story &#8220;Those Who Walk Away from Omelas&#8221; by the American writer Ursula K. Le Guin (1929&#8211;2018).</p>

<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192036256"><strong data-effect="bold">Immanuel Kant, 1724&#8211;1804</strong></p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm166374672">The sage of K&#246;nigsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad in Russia), <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_term276" group-by="K">Kant</span> taught philosophy at the University of K&#246;nigsberg for several years. In fact, throughout a very long lifetime, especially by the standards of the eighteenth century, he never traveled far from the city where he had been born.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm190692672">Kant&#8217;s parents were members of a strict sect of Lutheranism called pietism, and he remained a practicing Christian throughout his life. Though he only occasionally noted religion in his writing, his advocacy of deontology cannot be understood apart from an appreciation of his religious faith. Religion and ethics went hand in hand for Kant, and God always remained the ground or matrix upon which his concept of morality was raised.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm207745056">Though he never married, Kant was by contemporary accounts no dour loner. He apparently was highly popular among his colleagues and students and often spent evenings eating and drinking in their company. He frequently hosted gatherings at his own lodging and served as a faculty master at the university. He was also a creature of habit, taking such regular walks through the neighborhood surrounding campus that residents could tell the time of day by the moment when he would pass their doorway or window.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm151644608">The term deontology stems from the Greek <em data-effect="italics">deon</em>&#8212;duty, obligation, or command. As an ethical system, it is the radical opposite of utilitarianism in that it holds that the consequences of a moral decision are of no matter whatsoever. What <em data-effect="italics">is</em> important are the motives as to why one has acted in the way that one has. So an action may have beneficial results, but still be unethical <em data-effect="italics">if</em> it has been performed for the wrong reasons. Similarly, an action may have catastrophic consequences, but still be deemed moral if it has been done on the basis of the right will.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm210626032">Not only is deontology non-consequentialist, it is also non-situationalist. That is, an act is either right or wrong always and everywhere. The context surrounding it is unimportant. The best example of this is Kant&#8217;s famous allusion to an axe-murderer who, in seeking his victim, must always be told the truth as to his would-be victim&#8217;s whereabouts. By Kant&#8217;s reasoning, one cannot lie even in this dire circumstance in order to save the life of an innocent person. Kant was not diminishing the significance of human life in holding that the truth must always be told. Instead, he was insisting that truth-telling is one of the inviolable principles that frames our lives. To lie&#8212;even in defense of life&#8212;is to cheapen and weaken an essential pillar that sustains us. Kant knew that this example would draw critics, but he deliberately chose it anyway in order to demonstrate his conviction about the rightness of certain acts.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm217425360">Perhaps the most well-known element of Kant&#8217;s ethics is his explanation of the categorical imperative, laid out in his <em data-effect="italics">Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Ethics</em>, 1785. This intimidating phrase is just a fancy way of saying that some actions must always be taken and certain standards always upheld, such as truth-telling. The categorical imperative has two expressions, each of which Kant regarded as stating the same thing. In its first expression, the categorical imperative holds that a moral agent (i.e., a human being imbued with reason and a God-given soul) is free to act only in ways that he or she would permit any other moral agent to act. That is, none of us is able to claim that we are special and so entitled to privileges to which others are not also entitled. And in its second expression, the categorical imperative stipulates that we must treat others as ends in themselves and not just as means to our own ends. So we can never simply use people as stepping stones to our own goals and objectives unless we are also willing to be so treated by them.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm192903904">Despite the enduring popularity of utilitarianism as an ethical system, deontology is probably even more pronounced within our moral sensitivity. Perhaps the best indicator of this is that most of us believe that a person&#8217;s motives for acting ought to be taken into account when judging whether those actions are ethical or unethical. To witness a famous literary example of this, Victor Hugo made clear in <em data-effect="italics">Les Mis&#233;rables</em> that his protagonist, Jean Valjean, became a hunted man simply because he stole bread to feed his starving family. By Hugo&#8217;s standards&#8212;and our own&#8212;Valjean truly committed no crime, and the tragedy of his life is that he must spend a significant part of it on the run from the dogged Inspector Javert.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm194791824">Deontology, like all ethical systems, has its critics, and they zero in on its inflexibility regarding acts which may never be permitted, such as telling a lie, even if it is to save a life. Still, the system continues to inspire a devoted following of philosophers to this day. In the twentieth century, this was notably represented by the British ethicist W. D. Ross (1877&#8211;1971) and the American political philosopher John Rawls (1921&#8211;2002). Those who embrace deontology are typically attracted to its deep-seated sense of honor and commitment to objective values in addition to its insistence that all humans be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm179299552"><strong data-effect="bold">John Rawls, 1921&#8211;2002</strong></p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm196076496">Though <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_term277" group-by="R">Rawls</span> considered himself to be a utilitarian, he also acknowledged that his moral philosophy owed much to the social contract tradition represented over the past few centuries by John Locke and David Hume, among others. To complicate Rawls&#8217; philosophy even further, there was a bit of deontology exhibited in it, too, through Rawls&#8217; sentiment was that political freedoms and material possessions be distributed as fully and widely as possible precisely because it is the right thing to do.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm191469024">Rawls is a uniquely American political philosopher, and this can be seen from his emphasis on political liberty. But this statement also speaks to his commitment to the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill, the second-generation leader of that movement. Hence Rawls&#8217;s assertion that he actually was a utilitarian at heart.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm195220592">Whatever the influences on his thought, Rawls was the most significant political philosopher ever to emerge from the United States, and probably one of the most influential ethicists in the West over the past several centuries. He labeled his ethics to be &#8220;justice as fairness,&#8221; and he developed it over nearly a lifetime. It was laid out formally in 1971 with the publication of his <em data-effect="italics">A Theory of Justice</em>, a treatise of more than 550 pages. Still, preliminary drafts of what became this book were circulating within philosophical circles beginning in the late 1950s.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm200436688">To be fair, Rawls insisted, human justice must be centered on a firm foundation comprising a first and second principle. The first principle declared that &#8220;each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others.&#8221; These liberties included traditional ones such as freedom of thought and speech, the vote, a fair trial when accused of a crime, and the ownership of some personal property not subject to the state&#8217;s seizure. Very few commentators have criticized this principle.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm184122432">It is the second principle, however, which has incurred the loudest objections. It consisted of two sub-points: first, socio-economic inequality is permissible only to the degree that it brings the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society. (Rawls labeled this the <em data-effect="italics">difference principle</em>.) And, second, authority and offices are to be available to everyone competent to hold them. (Rawls called this <em data-effect="italics">fair equality of opportunity</em>.) Additionally, the training to ensure that all may merit these offices absolutely must be available to all.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm203278640">What Rawls actually advocated was an at-least minimal distribution of material goods and services to everyone, regardless of what inheritance he or she might come by or what work he or she might engage in. And this tenet has incurred a firestorm of controversy. Many have embraced what they term Rawls&#8217; egalitarian perspective on the ownership of property. Yet others have argued that he ignored the unlimited right to ownership of personal property specifically predicated on hard work and/or bequests from family. On the other hand, pure Marxists have dismissed this principle as not going far enough to ensure that sizable estates, as well as the means of production, be extracted from the clutches of plutocrats.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm210460256">How might society move toward justice as fairness? Rawls proposed a thought exercise: If we all could imagine ourselves, before birth, to be in what he calls the Original Position, knowing only that we would be born but without knowledge of what sex, race, wealth, ethnicity, intelligence, health, or family structures we would be assigned, then we necessarily would ensure that these two principles would be observed. We would do so because we would have absolutely no way of predicting the real-life circumstances which we would inherit post-birth and wouldn&#8217;t want to risk being born into an impoverished or tyrannical environment.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm191941872">The reason why we would be blind as to the world that each of us would inhabit would be because we would be cloaked by a &#8220;veil of ignorance&#8221; that would screen us from pre-knowledge of our circumstances once we were born&#8212;in other words, viewed from the original position, we wouldn&#8217;t take the chance of suffering from political oppression or material poverty. Self-interest, then, would motivate us to insist that these minimum levels of political and material largesse would be the birthright of all.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm198027680">Of course, we can&#8217;t return to our pre-birth stage and so negotiate this sort of arrangement beforehand. Hence, the only way of creating this sort of world now would be to imagine that we were in the original position and deliberately build such a fair environment for all.</p>
<p id="auto_762d296a-e1e1-4b8f-a93b-752a523c39f7_fs-idm167517280">Given human nature and its inherent selfishness, is it reasonable to expect human beings to make a concerted effort to create the structures needed for justice as fairness? Perhaps not, but realize that Rawls was only following in the footsteps of Plato in his proposal to craft a perfect <em data-effect="italics">polis</em>, or city-state, in <em data-effect="italics">The Republic</em>. Therein Plato took all of the beauty and wisdom of the Athens of his day and imagined it without any of its limitations. Plato knew that this was an ideal, but he also realized that even an attempt to build such a city-state would produce what he regarded as much incalculable good.</p>

At its origin, when it was a mere convenience store and still called Pronto Markets, founder Joe Coulombe opted to pay his employees at the median California family income rate. He did not want to exploit his employees the way he felt other large convenience chains did at the time.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref1"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote1">1</a></sup> After reading about the looming threats to the environment in 1970, Joe transformed his stores to become more health and environmentally conscious. Indeed, as far back as 1977, the growing chain of grocery stores began selling reusable &#8220;Save-A-Tree&#8221; canvas bags to its customers to encourage more environmentally friendly shopping practices.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref2"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote2">2</a></sup></p>

With more than four hundred stores nationwide, this chain of grocery stores specializing in reasonably priced, high-end cheeses, wines, and organic foods is a beacon of ethical business practices in the grocery industry.</p>

Bane has held firm on the ethical values established decades before. As part of his leadership approach, he often works in his stores so he can interact with customers and employees. He imagines the organizational principle at work at Trader Joe&#8217;s as an inverted pyramid, where he as CEO sits at the bottom of the pyramid and the many employees and customers are at the top.

Her father worked for the GM brand Pontiac for nearly four decades and one of her first jobs was working at a GM plant herself checking the fender panels and hoods of cars rolling off the line when she was only eighteen years old.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm355567344">After earning a degree in electrical engineering from the General Motors Institute (now called Kettering University) in Flint, Michigan, she returned to the company to work as an engineer for Pontiac&#8217;s new sporty two-seater, the Fiero. After a few years working as an engineer, GM then sent her to Stanford University on a fellowship to earn a master of business administration. From there, she climbed the executive ladder, working in a variety of positions until, in 2014, she was named CEO of General Motors Company, becoming the first woman ever to hold that position at a major international automaker.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref8"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote8">8</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm357942960">When Barra took the reins of the company, the once-dominant automobile manufacturer had undergone a considerable decline in influence and prestige. The Great Recession hit the already struggling company very hard. As a result, it was compelled to seek bankruptcy and government support. It also went through some painful downsizing, even going so far as to discontinue the very Pontiac division Barra once worked for as a young engineer.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm342736432">Just a few years later, GM appears to have turned those lemons into lemonade. It is now a healthy company with billions in cash on its books and billions in earnings. How it got to this healthy position is due in large part to Barra&#8217;s efforts to transform GM&#8217;s famously large and clumsy bureaucracy, as well as her push to encourage diversity of thought, innovative ways of dealing with problems, and working more closely with GM&#8217;s many stakeholders.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref9"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote9">9</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm348031632">But, this success aside, there were huge ethical bumps in the road that appeared right at the time Barra took control. In the spring of 2014, a string of news stories emerged regarding possible defects in the Chevy Cobalt, a GM compact car that started coming off the line in 2004. These stories eventually uncovered the fact that GM insiders had known of the defect and covered it up for a decade, even when they knew the defect was causing needless injuries and deaths.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm329836448">The press attention was a mounting disaster for GM, and Barra&#8217;s action was crucial. As the country condemned GM, Barra announced that &#8220;whatever mistakes were made in the past, we will not shirk from our responsibilities now and in the future. Today&#8217;s GM will do the right thing.&#8221;<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref10"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote10">10</a></sup> Barra jettisoned the &#8220;cost culture&#8221; that had precipitated the defect and cover-up, and replaced it with a &#8220;customer culture.&#8221; She also reformulated GM&#8217;s code of ethics and published a booklet on the code called <em data-effect="italics">Winning with Integrity</em>. Although some have pointed to some weaknesses in the code, it remains an important step for GM in encouraging personal integrity and empowering GM employees to speak up.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref11"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote11">11</a></sup> These days, GM and Barra hope the tragic lapse in ethics the company is now safely in the rearview mirror.</p>

At only 15 years old, he had already started his own software company. The profits from that company were enough to put him through college. When he graduated, he jumped right into a position at the software company Oracle, quickly climbing the corporate ladder and becoming the youngest vice president in the company&#8217;s history within a few years.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref12"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote12">12</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm357891408">Benioff eventually left Oracle to start his own software company, <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term283" group-by="S">Salesforce</span>. At its inception, Salesforce was a revolutionary approach to software, in that it delivers centrally hosted applications over the Internet to its clients. The bold move of charting a cloud approach to computing proved successful and, as of 2017, Salesforce was pulling in $8.39 billion in revenue.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm355745232">Rather than take his success for granted, however, Benioff has tried to use his wealth and position of power to support ethical causes, such as promoting sustainable growth and diversity. He is a big supporter of stakeholder capitalism as well.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref13"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote13">13</a></sup> This is an approach to business that attempts to consider the interests of all major stakeholders rather than catering merely or disproportionately to the investors.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm345051408">And Benioff has tried to put his money where his mouth is. Since 1999, he has maintained what he calls his &#8220;1-1-1 model.&#8221; This is a company program that donates 1% of equity, 1% of employee time, and 1% of products to nonprofit organizations operating in locations where his companies do business. According to Benioff, this is just one way for him to demonstrate that &#8220;the business of business is improving the state of the world.&#8221;<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref14"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote14">14</a></sup> Another way is by ensuring that there is pay equity between men and women working in the same positions in his company. When Benioff realized a few years ago that men and women were not being paid at a comparable rate, he took action to change this.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref15"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote15">15</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm353915040">Beyond philanthropy and striving for equity in his company, Benioff recognizes that technology innovators like himself need to take initiative in ensuring that business is done ethically. He knows that the volume of innovation coming out of the industry makes it difficult to manage, and he does not trust individual CEOs and companies to always do the ethical thing. &#8220;We&#8217;re moving rapidly into a new world where we know the government is going to have to be involved in these next-generation technologies&#8212;like AI [artificial intelligence], biotech, etc.&#8212;which are all so new, and could have unintended consequences,&#8221; he said in 2018. To manage the disruption that comes with these changes, he suggested it might be necessary to create a regulatory government body not unlike the Food and Drug Administration, except for technology.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref16"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote16">16</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm346618992">Recently, his ethical approach to business has led him to speak out on the autocratic style of many other leaders in Silicon Valley. Speaking in Davos, Switzerland, in 2018, Benioff challenged leaders in technology to step back from the all-too-common position he summarized as, &#8220;I&#8217;m the entrepreneur and I am in charge no matter what happens.&#8221; Citing the infamous aggressive leadership style of Uber&#8217;s founder and former CEO, Travis Kalanick, he warned against adopting this approach. Instead, he proposed they embrace the concept of trust.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref17"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote17">17</a></sup> &#8220;It&#8217;s a culture issue.

If anything trumps trust, we are in trouble.&#8221;<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref18"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote18">18</a></sup></p>

<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm346033280">Born months before the infamous Black Thursday stock market crash of 1929, Jack <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term284" group-by="B">Bogle</span> knows from experience the social and economic cost of unethical and unregulated stock market speculation. In the depression that followed the crash, his family lost much of its wealth, and his father sunk into a destructive alcoholism that tore the family apart. He and his twin brother were compelled to enter the workforce at early ages, holding menial jobs like delivering papers and waiting on tables.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref19"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote19">19</a></sup> The experience was formative for Bogle, who admits he feels sorry for those who do not grow up in circumstances where they have to work for what they need. Despite earning a comfortable fortune in managing mutual funds, Bogle remains reluctant to spend money on himself, believing that extravagance is a weakness that exposes him to unnecessary risk.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref20"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote20">20</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm351176000">After graduating with a degree in economics from Princeton University in 1951, Bogle went directly into the banking and investment industries. He quickly demonstrated an aptitude for making wise investments and rose up the ranks at Wellington Fund, eventually becoming the chairman in 1970. In 1975, he founded <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term285" group-by="T">The Vanguard Group</span>, an investment firm based on the principle that fund shareholders own the funds and, therefore, own Vanguard. There are no outside owners seeking profits at Vanguard.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref21"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote21">21</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm346062256">This simple but revolutionary founding ethical standard has earned Bogle accolades from thought leaders around the world. Economist and former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, Alan S. Blinder, for example, has celebrated Bogle&#8217;s &#8220;relentless voice, sharp pen, and indefatigable energy . . . prodding the mutual fund industry in particular, and the financial industry more generally, to embrace higher business, fiduciary, and ethical standards.&#8221;<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref22"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote22">22</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm353323168">Beyond establishing his client-centered approach to money management, Bogle has become an important voice advocating for ethical business practices. Too often, Bogle complains, CEOs in the investment business are compelled to make bets in the expectations market rather than to do what they are supposed to and build real corporate value. The result of this type of thinking and practice has been to distort the financial system. Instead, Bogle proposes following simple ethical guidelines such as seeking higher profits for investors rather than managers, treating the client as an owner rather than a customer, and limiting risk. These guidelines have worked for him and have made a lot of money for his clients. It turns out, he contends, that &#8220;good ethics is good business.&#8221;<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref23"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote23">23</a></sup></p>

<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm353329552">Yvon <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term286" group-by="C">Chouinard</span> was introduced to rock climbing almost by accident. After taking an interest in falconry, an adult decided to teach the young Chouinard to rappel down a cliff to reach the cliff-side falcon nests. But it was not long before Chouinard was teaching himself how to climb up in the same way. Thus began a life-long love affair with climbing around the world. To support his climbing lifestyle, he learned to make and sell steel climbing pitons, the small metal spikes with an eyelet that climbers drive into the rock to guide their rope.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm350254064">The piton business proved successful and eventually became Chouinard Equipment, the largest supplier of climbing hardware in the United States. But with this success, Chouinard was suddenly faced with his first ethical dilemma. As climbing became more popular, more pitons were driven into the rock, sometimes causing great damage. This was something Chouinard&#8217;s internal sense of environmentalism could not tolerate, so he made the ethical move to phase out the pitons and sell more environmentally friendly aluminum chocks instead. Around this same time, Chouinard began experimenting in the active sportswear business. Soon the clothing line outpaced the gear line. The <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term287" group-by="P">Patagonia</span> clothing line was born.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm349888880">Despite Chouinard&#8217;s growing success, his interest in environmentalism never flagged. Indeed, if anything, it increased. The 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s were decades of increasing public awareness about the dangers of environmental neglect and the growing threat of climate change. It was at this time that terms like &#8220;acid rain,&#8221; &#8220;the ozone layer,&#8221; &#8220;global warming,&#8221; and &#8220;deforestation&#8221; became common rallying cries for environmentalists around the world. Chouinard wanted to make Patagonia part of the movement for change. Beginning in 1986, Patagonia committed to donating 10% of its annual profits to environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Two years later, Patagonia led its own effort to save Yosemite Valley from overdevelopment.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm356721424">This concern with environmentalism has continued with the coming on board of Rose Marcario as CEO in 2012. She shares Chouinard&#8217;s goal of applying more ethical and environmentally friendly protection methods. Using solar energy and radiant heating in their plants and retail stores, Patagonia has been able to reduce its carbon footprint. It also strives to use recycled content in its clothing and to exclude dyes that require toxic ingredients. Patagonia also switched to using only organic cotton for its cotton products to reduce its reliance on chemical pesticides. Recently, Marcario has taken up environmental activism. Alongside Chouinard, Marcario decided to protest attempts to rescind the national monument designation of Bears Ears in southeastern Utah, first by withdrawing Patagonia from the annual Outdoor Retailer trade show in Salt Lake City in February 2017, and then by suing the Trump administration for its decision to reduce the monument&#8217;s size.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref24"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote24">24</a></sup> Like Chouinard, Marcario believes strongly in maintaining public lands free of private development. Many decades after it was founded as an outdoor clothing line, Patagonia&#8217;s policies remain consistent with the environmental ethics of its founder.</p>

<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm347458128">Born to Taiwanese immigrants in Illinois and raised largely in San Francisco&#8217;s Bay Area, Tony <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term288" group-by="H">Hsieh</span> excelled at school as a child. He developed an interest in computers, which helped get him accepted to Harvard University, from which he graduated in 1995 with a degree in computer science. Upon graduation, he jumped right into the corporate world by taking a position at Oracle, a large database and software company.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm352937600">At the time, Hsieh felt he had made it. His hard work had paid off and he was now perched firmly on the ladder to corporate and business success. Five months later, however, Hsieh abruptly quit. &#8220;I did not want to carry on with my job just because it paid me a handsome salary. The job lacked creativity and the corporate environment wasn&#8217;t my style.&#8221;<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref25"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote25">25</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm350206592">Within a few months, Hsieh and another former Oracle employee, Sanjay Madan, launched their own business from the stuffy confines of their apartment. The company was called LinkExchange, an innovative advertising cooperative that used the power of the emerging Internet to amplify advertising. The company proved to be a huge success. Within two years, it had acquired nearly half a million members and displayed ten million advertisements per day. Microsoft bought it in 1998 for $265 million.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm345992848">After his success with LinkExchange, Hsieh was encouraged to become CEO of the newly created <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term289" group-by="Z">Zappos</span>.com, an Internet shoe retailer. As CEO, Hsieh has embraced ethical behavior through what has been termed &#8220;radical transparency,&#8221; where he openly shares his schedule and even his personal and company priorities. Hsieh believes strongly that this transparency helps build trust with his employees and other stakeholders.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref26"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote26">26</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm353388352">Beyond transparency, Hsieh&#8217;s ethical approach has created a strong office culture that encourages team unity, camaraderie, and employee empowerment. The organizational atmosphere at Zappos rejects hierarchy and management, and encourages creativity, even wackiness. And Zappos has extended this ethical approach to community involvement as well. Hsieh dumped his heart, soul, and $350 million of his own money into an urban revitalization project of the small part of Las Vegas surrounding the company. He has transformed it into vibrant and hip neighborhood of vinyl record shops, independent bookstores, trendy restaurants, and free live music. The company and its surrounding neighborhood are now almost seamless. As a result, periods of work and periods of play in the company also intermingle.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref27"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote27">27</a></sup> In this way, the company is now a manifestation of Hsieh&#8217;s bold rejection of the stiff corporate culture he rejected at Oracle. And it may very well transform corporate culture entirely.</p>

<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm352604576">In 1988, while working in Europe as an electrical engineer, Jeff Lebesch took a beer-tasting trip through Belgium riding atop a fat-tire bicycle. A couple years later he met Kim <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term290" group-by="J">Jordan</span> and they soon married. Both being beer aficionados, they could smell a great business opportunity bubbling up from Jeff&#8217;s experience. Sensing that the famously bold flavors of Belgian beer were exactly what the American beer market lacked and needed, Jeff and Kim got to work testing methods and recipes in their Fort Collins, Colorado, basement. By 1991, <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term291" group-by="N">New Belgium Brewing</span> was born.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref28"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote28">28</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm355872000">The brewery emerged at just the right time: Young Americans were just beginning to expand their general appreciation for craft brews. Over the next nine years, the company grew steadily. Then, in 2000, Jordan decided to grow the company in a new and radically different way. Inspired by her Quaker background, she started New Belgium&#8217;s employee stock ownership program (ESOP). She had to battle the many advisers and accountants that came out against the move, but Jordan thought it was an important ethical move to give the employees a stake in the business.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref29"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote29">29</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm352335328">By 2012, Jordan had sold her last piece of ownership in the company to the ESOP. She knows that had she held onto this piece, she would have made even more money. But it was not necessarily money she was after. She wanted her employees to feel they were a part of the company and had a say in its operations. She felt this was the ethical and neighborly thing to do. According to Jordan, &#8220;We spend a lot of time at this thing called work, and if it can&#8217;t feel warm and like everyone you see every day has your back, then I think that&#8217;s a real tragedy.&#8221; To Jordan&#8217;s great credit, the ESOP has proven to be a great business success. In 2015, the company became the fourth largest craft brewer, selling nearly a million barrels in that year and pulling in $225 million in sales.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref30"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote30">30</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm353370800">And Jordan&#8217;s ethical principles have been a driving force in the business even beyond transforming her employees into joint owners. New Belgium is particularly interested in demonstrating that it is environmentally safe and sustainable. For example, in 1998, it became the first U.S. brewer to power its entire operation with wind-produced electricity. In 2002, it completed a biological wastewater facility that would clean the water left over by the brewing process before releasing it back into the environment. It also uses natural draft cooling and swamp-cooling systems rather than the less environmentally friendly glycol-cooled systems for its cold storage.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref31"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote31">31</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm345322896">Nor is Jordan content with only her environmental achievements. New Belgium Brewing is also a leader in philanthropy. It donates $1 to charities in its distribution territory for every barrel of beer it sells. Over the years, this has translated into millions of dollars in donations, and in 2018, the company projects that it will donate more than $900,000 to projects across the country.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref32"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote32">32</a></sup> It also manages a volunteer corps it calls the Beer Scouts, which finds and helps supply volunteers for causes aligned with New Belgium&#8217;s values.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref33"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote33">33</a></sup> Finally, it collaborates with a number of organizations supporting business ethics and nature conservation, such as Conservation Colorado, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the American Sustainable Business Council.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref34"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote34">34</a></sup></p>

<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm341920896">What might a company like <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term292" group-by="P">PepsiCo</span>, known for selling sugar-filled sodas and junk food, teach us about ethical business practices? It might actually teach us quite a lot if CEO Indra <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term293" group-by="N">Nooyi</span> has anything to say about it.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm346317232">Born in India and having immigrated to the United States at a relatively young age, Nooyi excelled at school and moved right into the business world after graduating from Yale University. In 1994, Nooyi came to PepsiCo as senior vice president for strategic planning. In 2006, she was promoted to president and CEO, and assumed the role of chairman in 2007. In August 2018, Nooyi announced she would be stepping down as CEO in October 2018 and leaving the position of chairman in early 2019. As CEO, she has tried to push PepsiCo in new and more ethical directions.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm341610544">Nooyi devised a sustainable-growth agenda for the company based on three pillars. The first pillar has to do with health and well-being. Through acquisitions, mergers, and other internal changes, Nooyi has tried to transform the Pepsi brand into more of an agent for change and healthy living. She does not want the company to be known merely as the junk food and sugary soda company. She believes in providing options to consumers and in making sure that PepsiCo&#8217;s traditional products are not unnecessarily unhealthy.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm345695552">The second pillar is a focus on the environment. Nooyi has driven PepsiCo to take notice of its reliance on exhaustible resources like water and she has led efforts to encourage greater energy conservation and recycling efforts. These are issues that are very personal to Nooyi, who grew up in a water-distressed city in India. She wants to use PepsiCo&#8217;s great resources not only to find ways to produce beverages that conserve water better but also to pass on this technology to local farmers so they can contribute to this process.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm346200880">The third pillar is about empowering people who typically lack power. She has promoted outreach to women and minorities so they feel comfortable and supported in the company. To do this, she has created daycare centers in the bottling plants, added maternity and paternity leave as company benefits, and even made religious accommodations. As she sees it, she wants to make PepsiCo a place &#8220;where every employee can bring their whole self to work and not just make a living but also have a life.&#8221;</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm355668912">Nooyi is a champion of what she calls &#8220;Performance with Purpose.&#8221; By this she means recognizing that a company&#8217;s performance in the marketplace is intimately connected to seeking ethical and sustainable approaches. Being a steward of the environment and encouraging tolerance and inclusion are not secondary functions for Nooyi; they are inherent in the company&#8217;s approach to business. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t focus on the environment, our cost will be too high. . . . and if we don&#8217;t have the best and brightest people, we won&#8217;t be able to deliver performance.&#8221;</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm353644384">Performance with purpose is different from mere corporate social responsibility. As she explains, &#8220;Corporate social responsibility is about spending the money you make. You make money and then you give it to a couple of charitable causes in some distant lands and feel good. This is not a feel-good program. This is who we are. You talk about ethics. The ethics of our company is performative purpose. The ethics of our company is the deep-seated belief that large companies can actually make a difference to societies in which we operate.&#8221;</p>

<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm352427072">Cherry Garcia, Wavy Gravy, and Chubby Hubby are just a few of the wacky flavors churned out by the four-decades-old ice cream company, <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term294" group-by="B">Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s</span>. These quirky names are a reflection of the company&#8217;s unique business style, something Jostein <span class="no-emphasis" data-type="term" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_term295" group-by="S">Solheim</span> signed on to when he agreed to become CEO of the company in 2010.</p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm343663728">Ice cream was nothing new to Solheim. Before becoming CEO, he had worked for Unilever&#8217;s many ice cream brands like Breyers, Klondike, Popsicle, and Good Humor. Indeed, the Norway native calls himself &#8220;an ice cream guy.&#8221; And he is wildly enthusiastic about maintaining Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s iconic weirdness, even celebrating Unilever&#8217;s acquisition of the company by eating a full pint of Chunky Monkey.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref35"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote35">35</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm345023344">But as Solheim knows, Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s is more than just an ice cream chain; it is also an organization dedicated to making a social impact. The founders of the Vermont-based company, Jerry Greenfield and Ben Cohen, transformed their ice cream&#8211;making success into a values-led social mission by supporting a host of ethical positions on such issues as responsible manufacturing, fair trade, and non&#8211;genetically modified organisms labeling.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref36"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote36">36</a></sup> And Solheim has embraced this important component too. He has led the company to establish public positions on racial justice in the United States, environmental activism, and even private prisons. &#8220;What inspires me,&#8221; Solheim said, &#8220;is what social impact can we create with this business.&#8221;<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref37"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote37">37</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm346454080">The activism Solheim supports through Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s springs from his understanding of the stakeholders in his company. For example, he refers to the consumers as &#8220;fans.&#8221; &#8220;They&#8217;re more than just customers,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;They are bigger stakeholders in our company and we have a responsibility to them beyond a basic transactional exchange of product.&#8221; And the same goes for the suppliers, farmers, and NGO partners. &#8220;They all connect in a model we called &#8216;linked prosperity,&#8217; which is circular and reinforcing.&#8221;<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref38"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote38">38</a></sup></p>
<p id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_fs-idm352658000">It is Solheim&#8217;s vision to see Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s as a leader in ethical change. Making a values-led company that embraces the concept of linked prosperity also highly profitable is major step in transforming the standard business model. He believes it is inevitable that other businesses will catch on and recognize they, too, have ethical obligations to uphold community values and recognize how their work affects the larger global community.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote-ref39"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#auto_175f9939-c7ae-4e25-8f56-dcdcf25b168e_footnote39">39</a></sup></p>

<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm190707632">Business ethics should be grounded in <em data-effect="italics">deontology</em> more than in <em data-effect="italics">utilitarianism</em>. That is, the ends should not typically be considered sufficient justification for the means when it comes to framing a business strategy. Rather, it is the means that ennoble the ends. Utilitarianism, as a consequentialist theory and when applied to business, emphasizes the greatest good (or profit) for the greatest number of shareholders. However, this may be inappropriate criterion for determining what is truly ethical in the conduct of business because business morality should not to be centered only on calculations of profit or loss. Deontology, on the other hand, focuses on the motives and reasons why entrepreneurs engage in business and the methods that they implement in doing so. Ultimately, both theories have a place in business practice, but a preference should be shown to deontology.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm237780048">The honor or shame that accrues to business as a profession is directly attributable to the ethical practices of its leaders. So, if business as a whole has an unsavory reputation, it is a likely consequence of the practices in which management engages. And while this reputation is not easily changed, it can be improved through a diligent commitment by management to do so.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm219361552">To pit <em data-effect="italics">ethics</em> against <em data-effect="italics">profits</em> and insist that a business leader must choose between the two is a false dichotomy. In truth, successful business can be practiced in ethical fashion. Further, ethical conduct by a business will naturally draw the loyalty of many consumers and clients. Not only that, but employees and other stakeholders of that business will also approve, and their relationship to the company might become even closer as a result.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm219855216">Similarly, it diminishes ethics to insist that it is useful only for keeping business leaders out of jail and avoiding opprobrium, such as through social media. Ethical behavior <em data-effect="italics">can</em> keep executives safe from indictment, but it also accomplishes much more. Ethical business practices honor the profession and endow it with integrity and credibility.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm239000784">When it comes to hiring for and promoting within the workplace, merit and commitment should be assigned the highest value. At the same time, <em data-effect="italics">merit</em> should not to be seen as a code word for discrimination; nor should it be disparaged. Business ethics applies to all people equitably in the sense that race, ethnicity, creed, sex, sexual orientation, age, and disability all are irrelevant to the abilities that they bring to the workplace.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm219855712"><h3 data-type="title">The Nature of the Ethical Business Leader</h3>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm208998912">An ethical business leader appreciates the existence of multiple stakeholders and accepts responsibility for all of them. These include employees, shareholders, customers/clients, vendors, suppliers, wholesalers, retailers, and the community as a whole within which a corporation resides. While not all stakeholders are <em data-effect="italics">equal</em> in significance, they nonetheless <em data-effect="italics">all are significant</em>.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm236205712">Ethical entrepreneurs are good stewards of the social and physical environments where they do business. They safeguard the earth at the same time that they protect human capital.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm228857824">In addition, the ethical executive engages in both private and corporate philanthropy. Thus, he or she is willing to commit a portion of the funds of his or her organization, as well as that of his or her personal wealth, to worthy charitable community organizations.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm205892400">Corporate professionals earn respect through the manner in which they lead and conduct business. There is no positive correlation between the trappings of their success&#8212;the homes they own, the cars they drive, the clothes they wear&#8212;and their character as human beings. The limousines and jets that they commandeer and the vacation resorts that they frequent are externalities completely unconnected with what Martin Luther King, Jr., called &#8220;the content of their character.&#8221; If anything, excessive material possessions blind business leaders to their most important managerial tasks.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm238313616">In truth, leaders who are in business only for the salary and attending perquisites have found the wrong profession, for they will constantly endure frustration in bearing the responsibilities that come with the privileges.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm206352944">And while successful executives are compensated more than their subordinates, it should not to be many multiples more. The less disparity that exists between the highest- and least-paid members of a company, the greater the level of teamwork and commitment that will prevail among all. In short, people will work harder and make a deeper commitment to a company that has a leadership team with which they can identify.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm214574112">Additionally, an MBA is not a license for arrogance on the part of its holder. Ethical leaders are justifiably proud of their business acumen, but to lord it over others risks sacrificing their effectiveness as managers. Sometimes the least educated member of a firm may know the most about sustaining the dignity and self-worth of everyone on the team and, therefore, may be the most essential employee for the company to have for that purpose.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm206395392">An accomplished executive is not insulated from his or her employees and should not be a &#8220;sir&#8221; or &#8220;ma&#8217;am&#8221; to subordinates, but rather a partner or colleague or coworker, and so, a concerned boss.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm217899376">In this same way, ethical leaders are welcomed and admired instead of feared and resented. Respect from colleagues, employees, and competitors ultimately cannot be compelled. Instead, it flows naturally from the just and fair ways in which leaders manage and compete.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm234733424">Worthy managers sustain the dignity and self-respect of all who surround them. This at once acknowledges the basic humanity of those with whom they work and simultaneously inspires them to contribute their best effort.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm238170688">Similarly, the best business leaders take pride in the accomplishments of the business and its employees. This success may never be accorded directly to managers themselves, but employees assuredly recognize those bosses who help them accomplish their best. Further, it is precisely this kind of leader for whom most employees will be motivated to go above and beyond merely what is required of them on the job.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm211560640">In short, ethical business executives become the enablers of professional success among their colleagues. This is not in the sense of being a slave to the business and its employees, but rather placing the interests of the firm and one&#8217;s coworkers above those of oneself. When this occurs, the enterprise succeeds in a way in which all associated with it may take pride. This is actually the essence of the best business leadership.</p>
<p id="auto_c157a5f7-239d-42af-8683-14223a66d041_fs-idm231058608">A goal of a more egalitarian workplace&#8212;one in which managers and employees respect one another&#8212;is a renewed sense of loyalty among all who are there. Too often today we witness distrust along the management/labor divide. Each side accuses the other of harboring no commitment except to itself. Unfortunately, the accusation frequently is true. One way to dispel it is for business leaders to take the first steps in restoring the broken sense of obligation that owners and employees owe each other. This may be the most important task of business leadership now and going forward.</p>

Furthermore, absenteeism reflects the health of employees, and their actions off the job help determine this. Conversely, permitting employers to stipulate worker behavior when not on the clock places great oversight in the hands of management and reduces individual autonomy significantly.</p>
